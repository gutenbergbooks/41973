<p class="quote">
     <em>July 15, 1660.</em>&mdash;Found the King gone this morning by 5 of
     the clock to see a Dutch pleasure boat below bridge, where
     he dines and my Lord with him.</p>

<p>In a further notice we find His Majesty winning the first yacht race in
the Thames, over the course of the R.T.Y. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>(p. 2)</span> Club, Greenwich to
Gravesend and back&mdash;a wager of one hundred guineas.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><em>January 13, 1660-1661.</em>&mdash;Lord's Day. To the Globe to
     dinner, then to Commissioner Pett, to his lodgings there,
     which he hath for the present while he is building the
     King's yacht, which will be a very pretty thing and much
     beyond the Dutchman's.</p>

     <p><em>January 15.</em>&mdash;The King hath been this afternoon to Deptford
     to see the yacht that Commissioner Pett is building, which
     will be very pretty, as also that his brother Christopher
     Pett (son of Phineas Pett) at Woolwich is making.</p>

     so small a vessel.</p>

     <p><em>May 21, 1661.</em>&mdash;To Deptford and took barge and were
     overtaken by the King in his barge, he having been down the
     river in his yacht this day for pleasure to try it; and I
     hear Commissioner Pett's do prove better than the Dutchman,
     and that his brother did build at Woolwich.</p>

     <p><em>October 1, 1661.</em>&mdash;Between Charles II. and his brother the
     Duke of York for 100 guineas. Sailing match from Greenwich

     yacht lately built by our virtuosoes. My Lord Brunkard and
     others, with the help of Commissioner Pett also, set out
     from Greenwich with the little Dutch 'Bezan' to try for
     mastery; and before they got to Woolwich the Dutch beat them
     half a mile. And I hear this afternoon that in coming home
     it got above three miles, which all our people were glad of.</p>

     <p><em>July 31, 1663.</em>&mdash;Sir William Petty's vessel, which he hath
     built on two keeles, a model whereof built for the King he
     showed me, hath this month won a Wager of 50<i>l.</i> in sailing
     between Dublin &amp; Holyhead with the ... Pacquett boat. The
     best ship or vessel the King hath there, and he offers to
     lay with any vessel in the world.</p>

<p>Amidst all the voluminous MSS. of the Admiralty secured and appropriated
by Samuel Pepys, it is unfortunate that no sketch or drawing of the
Royal yacht of Charles II. is to be found. Search is vain among the
papers at Cambridge, where most of the Diarist's gleanings are
preserved. We must, therefore, start with existing Royal yachts,
beginning with that built for King George III. in 1814, and now lying in
Portsmouth Harbour.</p>

<p>The Royal yacht 'Royal George' was laid down at Deptford, May 1814,
designed by Sir Henry Peake, Surveyor of the Navy, and she was launched
at Deptford in July, 1817. Her dimensions were as follow:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>(p. 6)</span> The 'Royal George' was used on Her Majesty's accession, 1837; she
was rigged as a ship, and was remarkable for excellent sailing
qualities. The captain appointed was Lord Adolphus FitzClarence, G.C.B.,
&amp;c. The 'Royal George' was laid up in Portsmouth Harbour, in charge of
the Master and only fitted out when specially required for Royal
service. The lieutenants, mates, assistant-surgeon, and crew were
stationed on board a 10-gun brig, H.M.S. 'Pantaloon,' attached to the
Royal yacht as tender. This vessel was employed in looking after
fishermen, carrying mails, and on other services that might be required.</p>

<p>'Esmeralda,' cutter, under command of the second master, was also
attached to the Royal yacht as tender.</p>

<p>On November 7, 1842, a new steam yacht, 'Victoria and Albert,' was laid
down at Pembroke Dockyard, and on April 26 next year she was launched.
She was designed by Sir William Symonds, Surveyor of the Navy.
Construction: diagonal principle, Dantzic oak without, horizontal
planking of Italian larch. This yacht, it may here be stated, was
subsequently, when a new 'Victoria and Albert' was built, known as the
'Osborne.'</p>

<p>In 1844, it is to be noted, it was ordered that the Royal yacht should
carry the Royal standard at the main, the Admiralty flag at the fore,
and the Union Jack at the mizzen, which order remains in force at the
present time. In this year, it should perhaps be added, the Queen stayed
at Osborne House, and in the following year the estate was purchased
from Lady Isabella Blatchford by Her Majesty. The steam yacht 'Fairy'
(screw) was built at this period.</p>

<p>Amongst interesting details which should here be recorded, it may be
remarked that in August of this year Her Majesty in the Royal yacht
visited Cork, and the Cove was henceforth called Queenstown. As regards
the speed and capacity of the 'Victoria and Albert,' her capabilities
for long cruises were tested in 1850. Leaving Plymouth Sound June 26,
8.45, she arrived in the Tagus off Belem, June 29, 3.10. Distance 772
miles in 66 hrs. 25 mins. Average speed 11<sup>6</sup>/<sub>10</sub> knots. Tried at a
measured mile with anthracite and Merthyr coal mixed, three years
afterwards, her average speed was 11 knots.</p>

<p>A new yacht, under the temporary name of the 'Windsor Castle,' was
started at Pembroke in February 1854, but a few weeks later its progress
was suspended to facilitate work for the Baltic and Black Sea fleets.</p>

<p>On January 16, 1855, the 'new' 'Victoria and Albert' was launched and
christened, and the name of the old yacht (built 1843) changed to
'Osborne.' The new 'Victoria and Albert' was designed by Oliver Lang,
Master Shipwright at Pembroke Yard.</p>

<p>Her Majesty's first cruise in the new yacht took place on July 12, and
next day she steamed round the Isle of Wight in 3 hrs. 25 mins. The
'Victoria and Albert' proved an excellent sea-boat. In a heavy gale soon
afterwards four line-of-battle ships drove; but Captain Denman reported
of the new Royal yacht, 'Splendid sea-boat, and rode out the gale with
extraordinary ease, not pitching at all, or bringing the smallest jerk
on the cable.'</p>

<p>As for speed, she was tried from Cork to Madeira, and returned from the
island, 1,266 miles, at an average rate of 10.8 knots. Cork to
Portsmouth, 341 miles, 22 hrs. 7 mins., average 15.4 knots, is also
noted.</p>

<p>The new yacht 'Alberta' (paddle steamer) was built in 1863.</p>

<p>All the fittings of the Royal yachts are as simple as possible, but the
perfect quality of material is not to be surpassed.</p>

<p>The appointments on these vessels are as follows: The commander, three
years; lieutenants, two years. One promoted at end of each year. Names
of all officers to be submitted to the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">THE ROYAL YACHT 'VICTORIA AND ALBERT,' 1843.</span><br>
(<i>First cruise</i>, 1843.)</p>
</div>

<p>The 'Victoria and Albert' always lies off Cowes during the Queen's
residence at Osborne in the summer. During the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>(p. 9)</span> winter, when the
Queen is at Osborne, she is in Portsmouth Harbour. The 'Alberta' always
brings the Queen from Gosport to Cowes, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, and, as a
rule, members of any Royal family. The 'Elfin' runs regularly with
messengers, bringing despatches as may be from time to time required;
the whole fleet is under the command of Admiral Fullerton, A.D.C., who
is always on board any of the yachts in which the Queen may embark. The
'Osborne' brings the Prince of Wales across to Cowes in the summer, when
the Prince and Princess and family live on board, remaining generally
for about three weeks. The 'Osborne' is an independent command, being
the Prince's Royal yacht. The grandest view of the Royal yachts is
obtained when Her Majesty inspects a fleet at Spithead. On these
occasions the 'Victoria and Albert,' with the Queen and Royal family,
the Lords of the Admiralty in attendance on board, is preceded by the
Trinity yacht 'Irene,' the 'Alberta' being on the starboard, and the
'Elfin' on the port quarter. Next come the Admiralty yacht
'Enchantress,' and the Lords and Commons,&mdash;generally in troopships such
as the 'Himalaya,'&mdash;others according to precedence.</p>

<p>The stately five-knot approach of these vessels is always very
impressive, and forms a nautical pageant well worthy of the Queen of
England and Empress of India, who has bestowed such munificent patronage
on the various yacht clubs of her realms, having presented since the
Accession no fewer than seventy-two valuable challenge cups to be sailed
for by all classes, besides the annual cups to the R.Y.S. since 1843.
The details of these will be recorded later on.</p>

<h3>THE ROYAL YACHT SQUADRON</h3>

<p>The present club-house of the Royal Yacht Squadron is of no modern date,
but a continuance of Cowes Castle, a fort built in the time of Henry
VIII. for the protection of the Medina River, which runs south and forms
a fine harbour for laying-up yachts of all sizes and classes, with
building yards on either <span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>(p. 10)</span> side; and a very busy scene it presents
during the fitting-out season.</p>

<p>The Castle was continued as a fort, and on the death of the last
Governor, the Marquis of Anglesey, who was a very great patron of
yachting small and great, the Marquis Conyngham took a lease of the
property from the Crown and passed it on in 1856 to the Royal Yacht
Squadron, which was established in 1812, as the seal shows. In 1815 a
meeting of the then club was held at the Thatched House Tavern, St.
James's Street, Lord Grantham in the chair, supported by Lords Ashbrook,
Belmore, Buckingham, Cawdor, Craven, Deerhurst, Fitzharris, Kirkwall,
Nugent, Ponsonby, Thomond, Uxbridge, Sirs W. Curtis, J. Hippesley, G.
Thomas, Godfrey Webster, Colonels Sheddon and Wheatley, &amp;c. when new
life was infused into the Association, and from that time the Squadron
has held the proud position of being the first yacht club in the world,
with the much-envied privilege and distinction of flying the White
Ensign.</p>

taken for the club-house, close to the Fort and Castle, whither, as just
remarked, they moved in 1856. It was at once rebuilt and enlarged. The
situation is beautiful, backed by large elm-trees. The platform commands
a grand view&mdash;towards the Motherbank, Ryde, and the Forts to the
eastward, with Calshot Castle, Portdown Hill, and Southampton Water to
the northward, and, away to the westward, Lymington.</p>

seconded: 'That the Commodore be requested to seek an interview or

Cup to be presented to the Yacht Club at Cowes.' The request was
graciously accorded. The list of Cups presented by Her Majesty is given

<p>The Squadron has always been characterised by the large and powerful
class of vessels composing it; and the oil picture now hanging in the

This is the 'Falcon,' 351 tons, full ship rigged, carrying eleven guns
on the broadside. The 'Pearl,' 130 tons, belonging to the Marquis of
Anglesey, is coming up on the left side, dipping her gaff-topsail to the
Commodore, who is under topsails with top-gallant sails loose; in the
distance is a yacht, 'Pantaloon,' belonging to the Duke of Portland,
brig rigged, with her topsail aback; a large schooner and several
cutters are included. An engraving of this picture is lettered thus:</p>

<p>'The Right Honourable Lord Yarborough's yacht "Falcon," of 351 tons, off
Spithead with the Royal Squadron, on their voyage to Cherbourg. Painted
by W. Huggins, Marine <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>(p. 13)</span> Painter to His Majesty, and published by
him at 105 Leadenhall Street. January 10, 1835.</p>

<p>This was a grand period in the club's history for large yachts. These
included the 'Pearl' and 'Alarm' cutters, and the schooners 'Dolphin'
(217 tons), 'Xarifa,' 'Kestrel,' and 'Esmeralda.' A picture of this
schooner, by Condy, is still in the possession of Lord Llangattock of
The Hendre. Then came the 'Arrow' cutter of 'Chamberlayne' fame, with
the well-known parti-coloured streak. She won and won until she was
requested not to enter, which was hardly reasonable, as the enthusiastic
owner improved her year by year, and kept well ahead of his day.</p>

<p>In 1843 the Royal Yacht Squadron gave a cup to be sailed for by the
Royal Thames Yacht Club at Cowes. A very good picture of the race was
painted by Condy of Plymouth. At that time the 25-tonners were the
representative craft in the Thames, and 'Mystery,' 'Blue Bell,'
'Phantom,' 'Cygnet,' and 'Gnome' were generally to the fore. When the
Thames matches were sailed there were invariably some representatives
from the Royal Yacht Squadron to attend the racing, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>(p. 14)</span>
everyone looked out for the white ensign. The 'Pearl,' belonging to the
Marquis of Anglesey, always ran up alongside the club steamer, and
dipped her ensign as her owner waved his glazed hat, standing by the
gunwale of his grand craft.</p>

<p>In those days there certainly was intense enthusiasm about the
25-tonners, and great was the enjoyment they afforded the visitors.</p>

<p>In 1851 the Royal Yacht Squadron gave a cup to be sailed for, and it was
won by the 'America' schooner, belonging to Commodore J. C. Stevens, of
the New York Club. In America it is always called the Queen's Cup, and
in England the 'America' Cup, but it is really the Royal Yacht Squadron
Cup. The Americans have held it ever since.</p>

<p>Luggers as yachts were common. In 1827 Lord Harborough <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>(p. 15)</span> had a
large lugger, the 'Emmetje,' of 103 tons, of which he was so proud that
he entered Ramsgate Harbour flying the coach whip of the Royal Navy,
until the officer of the Coastguard came on board and hauled it down.
Some thirty years afterwards came a revival when Lord Willoughby De
Eresby brought out in 1859 his celebrated lugger the 'New Moon.' She was
larger than Lord Harborough's&mdash;209 tons, 134 ft. long, 18 ft. 5 in.
beam, constructed at Hastings. Her highest speed was attained on long
reach, and was shown on the occasion of her racing back to Harwich. In a
fine breeze she went away from the other yachts, going 14 or 15 knots;
but ill fate awaited her; she had to make two boards to fetch the Cork
Lightship and the Bell Buoy. That was her destruction; the time taken to
dip the enormous lugs in going about allowed the others, who had been
nearly hull down, to overhaul her, so necessary is it to have a craft
that comes round like a top with canvas easily handled.</p>

<p>The Jubilee of the Yacht Club was celebrated at Cowes in 1865, and
another notable event took place on the occasion <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>(p. 16)</span> of the Queen's
Jubilee, June 21, 1887. A procession of the Royal Yacht Squadron
man&oelig;uvred in two columns, canvas and steam, finishing up with a

<p>The fastest yachts in the Royal Yacht Squadron are shown, of course, in
the list of Queen's Cup winners, which forms a befitting annual history.
Yachting in early days, however, was real yachting in its truest sense,
cruising about, that is to say, for the sake of peace and rest; the
vessels were generally schooners of considerable tonnage for sea
cruising. We have no longer 'Alarm,' 248 tons, 'Aurora Borealis,' 252
tons; but the faithful 'Egeria,' 152 tons, belonging to Mr. Mulholland,
now Lord Dunleath, is still with us. In 1852-53 there were only two
steam yachts in the Squadron, which was averse to the new comers; but by
degrees a fine schooner class with auxiliary steam was introduced,
including, of well-known boats, 'Sunbeam,'<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2" title="Go to footnote 2"><span class="smaller">[2]</span></a> 1874; 'Czarina,' 1877;
'Wanderer' and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>(p. 17)</span> 'Lancashire Witch,' 1878. New members from 1890
to 1892 added 7,000 tons to the fleet, principally steamers up to 1,000
tons and more.</p>

<p>The German Emperor, who became a member in 1891, in that year brought
over the 'Meteor,' <i lang="fr">née</i> 'Thistle,' to compete for the Queen's Cup, and
evinced the greatest enthusiasm, sailing in her for the prize, August 3.
The 'Meteor' finished first, but the 'Corsair,' 40 tons, Rear-Admiral
Victor Montague, R.N., came up with a smart breeze, saved her time, and
won.</p>

<p>Much interest was also taken in the presence of a 40-tonner, designed by
Mr. G. L. Watson for Prince Henry of Prussia, and steered by the Prince,
who seemed thoroughly to enjoy it, and remained all day at the tiller&mdash;a
sort of thing the British public fully appreciate. Unfortunately the
wind was not true.</p>

<p class="smcap">ROYAL YACHT SQUADRON.<br> QUEEN'S COURSE.</p>
</div>

<p>The majority of members of the Squadron own, and chiefly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>(p. 20)</span> use,
large yachts, but not a few of them are practical seamen. One prominent
member, Lord Dufferin, is specially notable as a keen devotee of
single-handed sailing, and is the owner of a famous boat, 'The Lady
Hermione.' The Editor has thought this an appropriate place to insert a
description of the pastime kindly contributed by his lordship, followed
by an account of his well-known boat.</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p class="add1em">SINGLE-HANDED SAILING</p>

<p class="smcap">By the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava</p>

<p>The wind blows fair, the vessel feels<br>
    <span class="add2em">The pressure of the rising breeze,</span><br>
  And, swiftest of a thousand keels,<br>
    <span class="add2em">She leaps to the careering seas.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The following description of 'The Lady Hermione' has been written by my
friend Mr. McFerran, who is a much better sailor than myself; but, as
the Editor has asked me to prefix a few observations of my own on
single-handed boat sailing, I have great pleasure in recommending to the
attention of the readers of the Badminton Library that exceptionally
pleasant form of sea adventure.</p>

<p>Probably the proudest moment of the life of anyone who loves the sea,
not even excepting the analogous epoch of his marriage morning, is the
one in which he weighs anchor for the first time on board his own
vessel. It is true that from the first hour he could call her his own
his existence has been a dream of delight, unless perhaps for the
passing cloud cast by the shadow of the cheque he has been required to
draw for her payment. As soon as she has come into his possession, her
ungainly naked bulk, as she lies upon the mud, assumes divine
proportions; and as by slow degrees her 'toilette' proceeds, her decks
whiten, her masts assume a golden hue and clothe themselves with sail
and rigging, his happiness becomes unspeakable. If he is animated by the
proper spirit, he has at once set himself to learn navigation; he has
plunged deep into <span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>(p. 21)</span> the 'Sailor's Manual'; and, to the amazement
of his female relations, he is to be seen busily employed in tying and
untying knots on short pieces of rope. But his principal preoccupation
is the fitting of his cabins. The mystery of the ship's practical
garniture he leaves to his master, as being beyond the utmost effort of
his intellect, though he has a certain satisfaction in knowing that he
possesses a pretty accurate knowledge of the way in which the framework
of the vessel has been put together.</p>

<p>At last everything is reported ready. He gives the order to weigh
anchor, and, as if by a magical impulse, he finds that the being upon
whom he has lavished so much affection has become a thing of life, has
spread her wings, and is carrying him into the unknown. He paces the
deck with telescope under his arm, in the proud consciousness that he is
absolute master of her movements, and that with a wave of his hand he
can direct her to the golden islands of the west or to the fabled homes
of Calypso and the Cyclops, according as his fancy may suggest. No
emperor or autocrat has ever been so conscious of his own majesty. But
soon a most unwelcome and humiliating conviction damps his exaltation.
He discovers that for all practical purposes of command and government
he is more incompetent than his own cabin-boy or the cook's mate: that
the real ruler of the ship's movements and destiny is his 'master,' whom
his crew call the 'captain'; and that the only orders he can issue with
a certainty that they are not open to criticism are those he gives for
his breakfast and his dinner, if indeed he is in a position to partake
of either. Officially he is gratified with the ambiguous title of
'owner,' while he is painfully conscious that his real social status is
that of a mere passenger, and that this unwelcome servitude has every
likelihood of enduring during his whole career as a yachtsman. He may
indeed, as a man of education, or perhaps of scientific attainments,
become in course of time a better navigator than many of the splendid
rough and ready sailormen who command the ships of our squadron; but,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>(p. 22)</span> unless he has been able to spend more time on board than their
multifarious occupations allow most owners of yachts to devote to
seafaring, he must know that it is idle for him to pretend to compete
either in seamanship or experience with the man whom he employs to sail
his vessel for him. In short, he remains an amateur to the end of the
chapter, and, if he is sensible and honest, is always ready to
acknowledge himself the disciple of the professional sailor.</p>

<p>But in single-handed boat sailing this humiliating sense of dependence
and inferiority disappears. For the first time in his life, no matter
how frequent may have been his cruises on bigger vessels, he finds
himself the <i lang="la">bona fide</i> master of his own ship, with that delightful
sense of unlimited responsibility and co-extensive omnipotence which is
the acme of human enjoyment. The smallness of his craft does not in the
slightest degree diminish the sense of his importance and dignity;
indeed, there is no reason why it should. All the problems which task
the intelligence and knowledge of the captain of a thousand-tonner
during the various contingencies of its nautical man&oelig;uvres have to be
dealt with by him with equal promptness and precision. Anchored in a hot
tideway and amongst a crowd of other shipping, he has perhaps a more
difficult job to execute in avoiding disaster when getting under way or
picking up his moorings than often confronts under similar circumstances
the leviathans of the deep; and his honour is equally engaged in
avoiding the slightest graze or sixpence worth of injury either to
himself or his neighbours as would be the case were a court-martial or a
lawsuit and 5,000<i>l</i>. damages involved in the misadventure. The same
pleasurable sentiments stimulate his faculties when encountering the
heavy weather which waits him outside; for, though the seas he
encounters may not be quite so large as Atlantic rollers, nor break so
dangerously as in the Pentland Firth, they are sufficiently formidable
in proportion to the size of his craft to require extremely careful
steering, and probably an immediate reduction of canvas under
conditions of some difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>(p. 23)</span> Nor are even misfortunes when they occur, as occur they must,
utterly devoid of some countervailing joys. He has neglected to keep his
lead going when approaching land; he has misread the perverse mysteries
of the tides, and his vessel and his heart stop simultaneously as her
keel ploughs into a sandbank. The situation is undoubtedly depressing,
but at least there is no one on board on this and on similar occasions
to eye him with contemptuous superiority or utter the aggravating, 'I
told you so.' Nay, if he is in luck, the silent sea and sky are the only
witnesses of his shame, and even the sense of this soon becomes lost and
buried in the ecstacy of applying the various devices necessary to free
his vessel from her imprisonment. He launches his Berthon boat, and lays
out an anchor in a frenzy of delightful excitement; he puts into motion
his tackles, his gipsy winches, and all the mechanical appliances with
which his ingenuity has furnished his beloved; and when at last, with
staysail sheet a-weather, she sidles into deep water, though, as in the
case of Lancelot, 'his honour rooted in dishonour stood,' the tragic
origin of his present trial quickly fades into oblivion, and during
after years he only recalls to his mind, or relates with pride to his
friends, the later incidents of the drama.</p>

<p>Another happiness attending his pursuit is that he is always learning
something new. Every day, and every hour of the day, the elements of
each successive problem with which he has to deal are perpetually
changing. As Titian said of painting, seamanship is an art whose horizon
is always extending; and what can be more agreeable than to be
constantly learning something new in a pursuit one loves?</p>

<p>I have heard it sometimes objected that single-handed boat-sailing is
dangerous. Well, all sport is dangerous. People have been killed at
golf, at football, and at cricket; nor is sitting in an easy-chair
exempt from risk; but during an experience of five and twenty years,
though laying no claim to much skill as a mariner, I have never had a
serious accident, though occasionally a strong tide may have swept me
whither I had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>(p. 24)</span> not the least intention of going; nor have I ever
done more than 10<i>l.</i> worth of damage either to my own vessel or my
neighbour's. The principal thing one must be careful about is not to
fall overboard, and in moving about the ship one should never leave go
one holdfast till one's hand is on another. It is also advisable not to
expose one's head to a crack from the boom as one is belaying the jib
and staysail sheets in tacking, for it might very well knock one
senseless.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would submit that to anyone wearied with the business,
the pleasures, the politics, or the ordinary worries of life, there is
no such harbour of refuge and repose as single-handed sailing. When your
whole thoughts are intent on the management of your vessel, and the
pulling of the right instead of the wrong string, it is impossible to
think either of your breakdown in your maiden speech in the House of
Commons, of your tailor's bills, or of the young lady who has jilted
you. On the other hand, Nature, in all her beauty and majesty, reasserts
her supremacy, and claims you for her own, soothing your irritated
nerves, and pouring balm over your lacerated feelings. The complicated
mysteries of existence reassume their primæval simplicity, while the
freshness and triumphant joyousness of early youth return upon you as
you sweep in a dream past the magic headlands and islands of the Ionian
Sea or glide along the Southern coast of your native land, with its
sweet English homes, its little red brick villages and homesteads
nestling in repose amid the soft outlines of the dear and familiar
landscape. The loveliness of earth, sea, and sky takes possession of
your soul, and your heart returns thanks for the gift of so much
exquisite enjoyment in the pursuit of an amusement as manly as it is
innocent.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Single-handed sailing need not preclude the presence of a lady
passenger. On the contrary, she will be found very useful on occasion,
whether in starting the sheets, in taking a spell at the wheel (for they
are all familiar with the art of despotic guidance), in keeping a sharp
look-out, in making tea, or in taking her part in a desultory
conversation.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>(p. 25)</span> 'THE LADY HERMIONE,' SINGLE-HANDED SAILING YAWL<br>
<span class="smcap">By James McFerran</span></h3>

<p>In the course of two summers passed on the shores of the Gulf of Naples
the writer had frequent opportunities of becoming acquainted with the
details of the construction, fittings, and equipment of a very
remarkable little yacht, whose white canvas for a couple of seasons was
constantly to be seen on that unrivalled sheet of water between the
months of June and October. He has thought that a description of the
vessel in question may prove interesting, not only to such of the
readers of these volumes as are devoted to the art of single-handed
sailing&mdash;that most delightful, manly, and invigorating of all
sports&mdash;but also to the general body of yachtsmen who, during the summer
and autumn months, fill, in ever-increasing numbers, our various
yachting ports with the most perfect specimens of the shipwright's craft
that the world can produce.</p>

<p>'The Lady Hermione,' as the vessel whose qualities and characteristics
it is proposed to describe is called, is the property of Her Majesty's
Ambassador at Paris, his Excellency the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava. His
Lordship, as is well known, has from very early days been a keen
yachtsman, and though for some time past he has had no opportunities of
indulging in his favourite pastime in large yachts, he has long been
devoted to sailing in vessels in which he comprises in his own person
the hierarchy of owner, master, and crew. During the last fifteen years,
in whatever part of the world he may have been, provided sailing were
possible, he has never been without a little ship specially constructed
for this form of amusement. In each succeeding vessel some new invention
or arrangement for her safer, easier, and more efficient handling has
suggested itself, and been worked out under the owner's direct
supervision. In the present boat the development of the single-handed
sailing yacht seems at last to have reached perfection, and it would
hardly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>(p. 26)</span> be possible for the most inventive mind to suggest an
improvement in her.</p>

<a id="img020" name="img020"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img020.jpg" width="400" height="367" alt="" title="">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;'The Lady Hermione.'</p>
</div>

<p>'The Lady Hermione' is a yawl-rigged yacht (fig. 1), built by Forrest &amp;
Son, of Wivenhoe, to the order of her owner. She is 22 ft. 9 in. long
between perpendiculars, 4 ft. 2 in. in depth, has a beam of 7 ft. 3 in.,
and a registered tonnage of four tons. She is built with mild-steel
frames, galvanised so as to resist the corrosive action of sea-water&mdash;a
mode of construction which has recently been adopted for
torpedo-boats&mdash;and is sheathed with East Indian teak and coppered. A
novel feature in the hull of so small a boat is its division into
water-tight compartments by transverse and longitudinal bulkheads,
composed of galvanised steel plates riveted to the steel frames. These
bulkheads form a large forward compartment, two compartments on each
side <span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>(p. 27)</span> of the cabin, and a compartment at the stern, thus
rendering the vessel water-tight as long as they remain intact.</p>

<p>On the deck, forward and aft, are hatchways which give entrance to the
bow and stern compartments respectively. The hatches to these openings,
which are kept constantly closed at sea, are fastened down with strong
gun-metal screws fitted with butterfly nuts, the screws being fastened
to the deck and made to fold down on it with joint when not in use. The
coamings of the hatchways, as well as the inner edges of the hatches
themselves, are lined with india-rubber, so as to render the covers
perfectly water-tight. Access to the side compartments is obtained by
means of manholes opening from the cabin, and covered with steel plates
screwed into the bulkhead. In the event of the yacht's shipping any
water, it is removed by a pump leading through the deck near to the
cockpit and within easy reach of the steersman's hand. The cover of the
pump works on a hinge, and lies flush with the deck when closed. The
pump-handle is made to ship and unship at will, and is in the form of a
lever, which renders the operation of pumping more easy than in the
ordinary form of pump usually employed in small boats (c, figs. 2 and
11).</p>

<p>'The Lady Hermione' is ballasted with lead, the greater portion of which
is carried outside in the form of a keel, which weighs about two tons.
On trial, it was found that the little craft was too quick on her
helm&mdash;a quality which, however useful in racing vessels, is undesirable
in a single-handed boat, where the operation of getting aft the sheets
when going about naturally requires somewhat more time than it does when
the crew is composed of more than one hand. In order to remedy this
defect a deep oak keel has been fixed outside the lead keel, and has to
a considerable extent answered its purpose. It has also added immensely
to the boat's stiffness; and it is blowing very hard indeed when a reef
requires to be taken down. In fact, owing to her deep build and her
heavy outside keels, 'The Lady Hermione' is virtually uncapsizable,
while her water-tight compartments render her unsinkable. It is
impossible to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>(p. 28)</span> overrate the value of these two elements of safety
in a boat which is always worked by one person and is taken out in all
weathers.</p>

<p>Stepping on board 'The Lady Hermione,' the visitor, however much he is
accustomed to yachts, is struck by the number and apparent complication
of the contrivances which meet his eye (fig. 3), the interior of the
vessel looking, as a witty naval officer once observed on being shown
over her, 'something like the inside of a clock'; but, after a few
explanations, the usefulness and practical efficiency of the various
devices become evident. The principle which has been adhered to
throughout in the rigging and fittings is, that all operations connected
with the handling and management of the boat shall be performed by one
person without the application of any considerable physical force. It
has also been laid down as a <i lang="la">sine quâ non</i> that everything shall work
perfectly in all weathers and under all conditions of wind and sea. The
result of the owner's ingenuity is, that the sails can be hoisted and
lowered, the sheets attended to, the anchor let go and weighed, and the
tiller fixed and kept fixed in any desired position, without the
necessity of the one person, who composes the crew leaving the cockpit.
The arrangements for carrying out these objects will now be described in
detail.</p>

<img src="images/img021.jpg" width="500" height="146" alt="" title="">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;'The Lady Hermione.' Deck plan.</p>
</div>

<p>The first contrivance which claims attention is that for keeping the
rudder fixed at any desired angle (figs. 4 and 5<span class="smcap">A</span>). In his account of
his cruise in the yawl 'Rob Roy' the late Mr. Macgregor says that he had
never seen any really satisfactory method of accomplishing this object;
but the difficulty <span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>(p. 29)</span> has been solved by Lord Dufferin, who,
indeed, has had fitted in many of his previous boats an apparatus
similar to that in the present one. On the deck aft, about a couple of
feet in advance of the rudder-head, are fitted two brass stanchions.
These support a brass bar which on its lower side is indented with
notches similar to the teeth of a saw, and of a depth of about half an
inch (<span class="smcap">A</span>, fig. 4). On the tiller there is fitted a brass tube or cylinder
made so as to slide backwards and forwards within a limit of some eight
or ten inches, and bearing on its upper surface a triangular fin of
brass (<span class="smcap">A</span>, fig. 5). When it is desired to fix the tiller in any
particular position, the cylinder is instantaneously slipped back until
the fin catches one of the notches of the bar, and the tiller is thus
securely fixed. The tiller is unlocked by simply flicking forward the
cylinder with the hand, the locking and unlocking being done in a
second. The toothed brass bar, it may be mentioned, is curved so that
the fin may fit into any desired notch, no matter at what an angle it
may be desired to fix the rudder (<span class="smcap">A</span>, fig. 4). The cockpit of the yacht
being somewhat small, it was found that when there was a lady passenger
on board the movement of the tiller interfered with her comfort, and, in
order to obviate this difficulty, a steering-wheel has recently been
fixed on the top of the cabin immediately in front of where the helmsman
stands (fig. 6). When the wheel is used a short tiller is employed, with
steel tackles leading from it through pulleys and fair-leads to the
wheel itself. The axis of the wheel carries a brass cap fitted with a
screw, by half a turn of which the steering apparatus can be locked or
unlocked, and the helm fixed in any position. If it is desired at any
time to substitute steering with the tiller for steering with the wheel,
the process is very simple. A brass handle of the requisite length, and
bearing a cylinder and fin as above described, is screwed on to the
short tiller, and the tiller ropes are cast off, the whole operation
being performed in a few seconds. The wheel, the stand for which slides
into brass grooves on the cabin top, can also be unshipped and stowed
out of the way in a very short time.</p>

<p>Fittings of 'The Lady Hermione.'</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>(p. 31)</span> We now proceed to examine the gear for letting go the anchor,
which, though difficult to describe, will readily be understood from the
drawing (fig. 7). The anchor, a Martin's patent, when stowed, rests upon
two crescent-shaped supports, which project from the bulwarks just
forward of the main rigging (<span class="smcap">A, A</span>', fig. 7). These supports are fixed to
a bar or tumbler lying close to the inside of the bulwark, and arranged
so as to turn on its axis (<span class="smcap">B</span>, fig. 7; and <span class="smcap">C</span>, fig. 12). Fixed to the
tumbler inboard there is a small bar which fits into a socket attached
to the covering board. On the socket is a trigger (<span class="smcap">C</span>, fig. 7, and <span class="smcap">D</span>,
fig. 12) from which a line leads along the inside of the bulwarks to
within easy reach of the cockpit (<span class="smcap">D</span>, fig. 7). By pulling this line the
socket is made to revolve, so as to release the arm; the weight of the
anchor forces the tumbler to turn on its axis, bringing down with it the
crescent-shaped supports, and the anchor falls into the sea.</p>

<p>This operation having been completed, it will probably be thought that
now at last the crew must leave his point of vantage, and go forward to
stopper and bit his cable. But no; we have not by any means yet reached
the limits of ingenuity displayed in this extraordinary little ship. The
chain cable runs out through a hawse-pipe in the bow, and across the
hawse-hole a strong steel plate or compressor, with a notch cut in it to
fit the links of the cable, runs in grooves. By pulling a line which
leads to the cockpit this compressor is drawn over the hawse-hole, and
the cable is thus effectually snubbed. When the anchor has to be got up,
or it is required to let out more chain, the compressor can be drawn
back by another line which also leads to the cockpit. These two
contrivances for letting go and stopping the anchor, together with the
apparatus for weighing it without leaving the cockpit, which will now be
dealt with, get rid of that fruitful source of discomfort in boats
manned by one hand&mdash;namely, the necessity of the solitary mariner's
having to go forward to deal with his ground tackle at a time when
perhaps he has other pressing calls on his attention in connection with
the management of his vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>(p. 32)</span> Equally as ingenious as the means of letting go the anchor is
the machinery employed for weighing it. The windlass used is an ordinary
yacht's windlass, except that on its outer end on its starboard side it
carries a cogged wheel (fig. 8). Close alongside the windlass there
rises from the deck a spindle cut with an endless screw (<span class="smcap">A</span>, fig. 9), the
threads of which take the teeth of the cogged wheel. This spindle runs
through the deck, and has at its lower extremity a cogged wheel (<span class="smcap">B</span>, fig.
9), fitting into another cogged wheel attached to a shaft, which runs
aft on bearings in the ceiling of the cabin to the cockpit (<span class="smcap">C</span>, fig. 9).
At the cockpit end it is furnished with a large wheel (<span class="smcap">D</span>, fig. 9, and
fig. 10), on turning which the motion is communicated through the shaft
and a system of cog-wheels (figs. 9 and 11), to the Archimedian screw
rising up through the deck forward, and this screw in its turn revolves
the windlass, and the anchor comes merrily home. The slack of the chain,
as it comes in, drops perpendicularly through the hawse-pipe to the
chain-locker below, and requires no attention or handling. The machinery
for getting the anchor possesses great power, and, even when the anchor
has a tight hold of the bottom, the wheel in the cockpit can be turned
almost with one finger. The wheel is made to ship and unship, and when
not in use is hung up to the side of the cabin. As a general rule,
especially when weighing in a crowded harbour, the anchor is simply hove
up close to the hawse-hole until open water has been gained, the ropes
carefully coiled down, and everything made snug and shipshape. The
vessel is then laid to, or the helm fixed so as to keep her on her
course, as circumstances may determine, and the crew goes forward to do
the one thing he cannot perform from aft, the catting and fishing of his
anchor. Suspended from the head of the mainmast is a tackle of the kind
known to seamen as a 'Spanish burton,' with a long iron hook attached to
its lower block. In fishing the anchor this burton is first overhauled,
and, leaning over the bow, the operator fixes the hook in a ring let
into the shank of the anchor at a point where the anchor exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>(p. 33)</span> balances itself when suspended horizontally. He then passes the
various parts of the fall of the tackle through an eye at the end of a
fish-davit&mdash;similar in shape to the boat-davits used in large
ships&mdash;which stands up from the deck close to the bulwarks, a little
forward of the supports for the anchor already mentioned (<span class="smcap">A</span>, fig. 12).
By pulling on the hauling part of the burton the anchor is raised close
to the end of the davit, and the davit, by an ingeniously arranged
spring, on a lever at its base (<span class="smcap">B</span>, fig. 12), being pressed with the
foot, can be swung round until the anchor is suspended immediately above
its resting-place, into which it is then lowered, the crescent-shaped
supports already referred to having been previously placed in position,
and the trigger locked. Here it rests in perfect security, and is ready
to be let go by pulling on the line attached to the trigger. On the port
side a second anchor is carried, an Admiralty pattern, weighing about
fifty pounds, and secured in precisely the same way as the starboard or
working anchor, though in weighing it the windlass is used with an
ordinary ratchet, as the windlass barrel on the port side is not
connected with the shaft previously described. It may here be mentioned
that the starboard barrel of the windlass can also be used in the
ordinary way, as the spindle with the endless screw already mentioned is
made with a joint, so that it can be disconnected from the cogged wheel
and laid down flat on deck out of the way whenever necessary (<span class="smcap">C</span>, fig. 8;
and <span class="smcap">D</span>, fig. 9).</p>

<p>We now pass on to what is the most important thing in all single-handed
sailing boats, the arrangement of the halliards and sheets in such a
manner that all operations connected with making and shortening sail can
be performed from the cockpit. In 'The Lady Hermione' this essential
principle has been carried out to its fullest extent. At the foot of the
mainmast on each side is a brass fair-lead fitted with ten or twelve
sheaves (figs. 13 and 14). Through these sheaves all the halliards
(except, of course, those connected with the mizzen) are rove, and then
led aft over the top of the cabin to within a few inches of the cockpit
(fig. 3). Here they are belayed to a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>(p. 34)</span> large belaying-pin rack
which crosses the cabin top in front of the steersman and within easy
reach of his hand (fig. 15). The frame of this rack is pierced with
horizontal holes for the ropes to pass through, after which they are
belayed to the pins, while the falls are allowed to drop down on to the
cabin floor, where they are snugly coiled away in a box with a number of
compartments which has been made to receive them. The object of passing
the halliards through holes in the belaying-pin rack is to afford a
straight pull when getting up sail, and to prevent the ropes from flying
away out of the steersman's reach when they are let go. 'The Lady
Hermione' is, or rather was originally, fitted with all the running
rigging that would be employed in the largest-sized yacht, and this will
give some idea of the number of ropes that have to be dealt with by one
person:&mdash;main and peak halliards, two topping-lifts, tack tackle and
tack tricing line, topsail tack, sheets, halliards, and clew line, jib
and staysail halliards, and jib and staysail down-hauls. As originally
rigged, main, peak, and jib purchases were employed for getting the
mainsail and jib well up, but the introduction of the gipsy winches
mentioned in the next paragraph rendered these ropes unnecessary, and
they have consequently been dispensed with. The system employed,
however, has always worked without the slightest hitch, and enables
whoever may be sailing the boat to attend to all the halliards without
leaving the helm. On the belaying-pin rack each pin has the name of the
rope for which it is intended engraved on a small brass plate, so that
no confusion can arise as to what part of the gear it may at any time be
desired to deal with; though, after a little practice, whoever is
sailing the boat knows the lead of each rope by instinct. At the foot of
the mizzen-mast fair-leads, similar to those near the mainmast, bring
the gear of the mizzen to within reach of the cockpit. The jib and
staysail sheets also lead aft, through bull's-eye fair-leads fixed
inside the bulwarks, and are belayed to cleats screwed on to the
coamings of the cockpit.</p>

<p>Even in a boat of the size now under description, it will be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>(p. 35)</span>
understood that the hoisting of the sails and the getting aft of the
head-sheets in a strong breeze would tax the strength of an ordinary
person; but, still carrying out the principle of doing everything with
the least possible exertion, small gipsy winches of a peculiar pattern
are largely employed, and form a very remarkable feature in the fittings
of the vessel (figs. 16 and 17). These winches are all made so as to be
easily shipped and unshipped at will, as they slide into brass grooves
affixed to the deck, and are worked with ratchet handles, to which are
attached strong steel springs in order to insure the ratchets always
biting in the cogs. Altogether, there are ten gipsy winches on board,
two on the deck on each side of the cockpit, two on the cabin top just
forward of the belaying-pin rack, and two on the deck in front of the
mainmast. The two on each side of the cockpit are used for the
head-sheets. The sheets, led aft as previously described, are given a
couple of turns round the barrel of the winch, and then belayed to their
cleats. In getting them in after going about, they are first hauled
hand-taut, then the ratchet handle is worked until they are as tight as
may be desired, after which they are belayed. These operations are
performed in a very few seconds, and the power of the winches is so
great that the sheets are got in flatter than would be possible by any
other means. The four winches on the cabin top are employed in the same
manner for the main and peak halliards, or for the topsail tack, sheet
and halliards, as may be required. The two forward of the mast are used
for any purpose for which it may be required to use a purchase. The
winches have all worked admirably from the time they were first fitted;
they are not in the least in the way, and the simplicity of their
operation and the extraordinary power which can be developed from them
would scarcely be credited by anyone who has not seen them in actual
use. The jib and staysail sheets were at first fitted with tackles; but
the introduction of the winches has rendered tackles unnecessary. For
the same reason, the main, peak and jib purchases, which were fitted
when the little vessel was first prepared for sea, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>(p. 36)</span> have been
dispensed with, as the winches give all the power that can be desired.</p>

<p>Forward of, and attached to, the mainmast a long hawser is kept
constantly stowed, to be used as a tow-rope in case towing by a
steam-launch or tug should be necessary, as sometimes happens in a calm.
This hawser is bulky and unwieldy to handle when wet, and it is
understood that on the first opportunity there is to be substituted for
it a light steel-wire hawser wound on a miniature but sufficiently
strong drum, carried forward, in the same manner that steel hawsers are
disposed of on the decks of large vessels.</p>

<p>Having now completed the description of the main features of the vessel,
a word or two may be said about her minor fittings, which are also
worthy of notice.</p>

<p>In most single-handed boats the helmsman is constantly bothered by his
head-sheets, especially when there is a strong breeze, getting foul of
something, thus necessitating his going forward to clear them. In 'The
Lady Hermione' this inconvenience is entirely obviated by brass guards
placed over all the projections upon which it is possible for a rope to
catch. In this way the fair-leads in the bow, the windlass and the gipsy
winches forward, are all protected, so that it is impossible for a rope
to get foul anywhere.</p>

<p>In order to harmonise with the rest of the metal-work, the screws by
which the rigging is set up are all of gun-metal, instead of the
galvanised iron usually employed for the purpose.</p>

<p>Round the entire gunwale there runs a steel-wire ridge-rope, supported
on brass stanchions, so that anyone moving about the deck in heavy
weather may have something to hold on by.</p>

<p>In front of the mast there is a ladder made of steel-wire rope with
wooden steps, leading from the deck to the crosstrees, which is very
convenient in case anything has to be done aloft. This ladder is set up
to the deck with brass screws, similar to those used for the rigging.</p>

<p>On the top of the cabin, in front of the steersman and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>(p. 37)</span> between
the gipsy winches, is a lifeboat liquid-compass fitted with a binnacle,
the compass, like almost every fitting on board, being made to ship and
unship, so as to be stowed out of the way when not in use (figs. 18 and
19).</p>

<p>As the little vessel when abroad was frequently sailed in the winter
months, when, even in the Mediterranean, it is somewhat bitterly cold, a
brass charcoal stove or chafing-dish of the kind used in Turkey, and
there called a 'mangal,' is fitted at the bottom of the cockpit. It is
covered with a brass grating, which forms a floor for the helmsman to
stand on; and the heat from below keeps him comfortably warm, even in
the coldest weather.</p>

<p>Another provision against the weather is a large umbrella for the use of
any lady passenger when sailing under a strong sun. When in use the
handle is fitted into a socket on the coaming of the hatchway, the
socket being fitted with a universal joint, so that the umbrella may be
adjusted in any desired position. There are two sockets, one on either
side of the cockpit, in order that the umbrella may be carried on
whichever side is most convenient (fig. 20).</p>

<p>On either side of the gunwale aft is fitted a brass crutch for
supporting the main boom when the vessel is at anchor (fig. 21). At sea
the clutches also serve the purpose of receiving the topsail-yard, one
end of which is stowed in a crutch, while the other is made fast with a
tying to the outside of the main rigging, thus getting rid of the
inconvenience of having such a long spar on deck.</p>

<p>A very important fitting is a hatch by which the cockpit can be
completely covered in in heavy weather. The hatch is made in sections
hinged together, its two halves being also hinged to the back of the
seats in the cockpit on either side. When unfolded and fixed in position
it covers the entire cockpit, with the exception of a small circular
opening left for the steersman, and the vessel is rendered almost as
water-tight as a corked bottle. This small circular opening can also be
closed, if necessary, by a wooden-hinged cover made for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>(p. 38)</span> Most of the running rigging is of white cotton rope, which looks
exceedingly smart and has answered its purpose fairly well; but it has
not the durability of manilla, and when wet it has a great tendency to
kink.</p>

<p>The cabin is very plainly fitted up, and is without berths or seats, its
only furniture being some racks and cupboards used for stowing away a
few necessary articles. When anyone sleeps on board, a mattress is
spread on the floor and forms a very comfortable bed.</p>

<a id="img023" name="img023"></a>

<p>Lord Dufferin's 'Foam,' R.Y.S. 'In high latitudes,'
1856.</p>
</div>

<p>In the cabin there is carried, folded up, a 10-ft. Berthon dinghy, which
can be expanded and launched in a few minutes. This does away with the
necessity of towing a dinghy, while there is not room to carry one on
deck.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be said that 'The Lady Hermione' presents a very
smart appearance and is an extraordinarily good sea-boat. The writer has
frequently seen her out in the Gulf of Naples in weather which even the
largest native craft would <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>(p. 39)</span> not venture to face. She is also
admirably sailed by her owner, and it is a great pleasure to watch her
being handled by him under sail, everything being done with great method
and system and in a highly seamanlike style. Her cruising ground has now
been transferred to the stormier regions of the English Channel; and two
summers ago she was sailed to Trouville, where she remained for some
time, running back to the Solent in October in half a gale of wind,
during which she behaved admirably, and made better weather than many
large vessels could have done.</p>

<p>This paper has run to a greater length than the writer at first
intended; but he trusts he will be forgiven in consideration of his
having made known to his fellow-yachtsmen the existence of what is
really a most unique and wonderful little craft. A model of her hull was
included in Messrs. Forrest &amp; Son's exhibit in the late Naval Exhibition
at Chelsea, and it is to be regretted that the vessel herself, or, at
all events, an accurate model showing her rigging and all her fittings,
was not on view also, for she would not have been by any means the least
attractive of the many nautical objects of interest contained in the
collection in question, which has done so much to make the British
public acquainted with the maritime history and greatness of their
country.</p>

<p>View from the Royal Western Yacht Club, Plymouth.</p>
</div>

<p>No wonder Plymouth was early in the field with yachting, in view of the
tempting facilities for every variety of aquatic pastime which nature
has there provided in the midst of lovely scenery, with shelter close at
hand in case of sudden change of weather; in fact, the whole atmosphere
is nautical with mighty precedents, for is not this the West-country
long famed for mariners with stirring historical associations? Who can
walk on the Hoe without thinking of Drake, of Armada fame, and the stout
hearts that gathered round him in the hour of need for the defence of
England against an overwhelming force? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>(p. 40)</span> Plymouth is a
delightfully picturesque spot. On the S.-W. is the seat of the Earl of
Mount Edgcumbe, where the timber is specially fine on the hills which
afford shelter from the prevalent S.-W. wind, and blow it truly can on
occasions, not infrequently at the Regatta time, when it is least
wanted, now that the small raters are in such force. Still it is
surprising what weather some of these little fellows make of it as they
round the Breakwater. The present club-house of the Royal Western Yacht
Club is situated at the west end of the Hoe. The view from the
club-house is extremely fine. On the right the wooded heights of Mount
Edgcumbe, with the Hamoaze beneath, a little to the right, also Drake's
Island and the starting point for yacht and trawler racing; due south
the great Breakwater, and in clear weather the new Eddystone Lighthouse.
Bearing to the left beyond the Breakwater is the well-known 'Mewstone'
and familiar 'Shag Rock,' whilst inside lie a variety of craft. Any
foreign men-of-war visiting Plymouth generally bring up at this spot,
and the training brigs 'Seaflower,' 'Pilot,' and 'Martin' give quite an
idea of old days in the British Navy, imparting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>(p. 42)</span> much life to
the whole sea view, for the lads are always getting under way, or
loosing sails, going out or coming in. On still to the left is a range
of high hills running out to the Start Point and Prawle Point, and just
beyond the Hoe to the eastward is the Catwater, where yachts get a snug
berth clear of the entrance to the inner harbour full of trawlers and
every possible variety of hookers, fishing craft, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="smcap">ROYAL WESTERN YACHT CLUB PLYMOUTH.</p>
</div>

<p>The Royal Western Yacht Club was established in 1827, and was at that
time known as the Port of Plymouth Royal Clarence Regatta Club; in 1833
it became the Royal Western Yacht Club. H.R.H. the Duke of Sussex
consented to become patron and H.R.H. the Duchess of Kent patroness,
eight presidents were appointed, one of whom, Sir T. D. Acland, is still
living in Devonshire. The vice-presidents, twenty-one in number, were
all men of high position and great influence. A most interesting list of
the yachts in 1835, giving the names of the boats, is still in the
possession of the club. Unfortunately there is not space to print this
in full, valuable as it would be as a record; still certain points must
be noted. There were 43 yachts in the list: of these 17 were
clinker-built, like the 'Harriet' cutter of Cowes, 96 tons, belonging to
Sir B. R. Graham, Bart., a very handsome craft carrying a crew of eleven
hands. Ten were carvel-built, 16 not classified. This was the period of
general introduction of carvel surfaces. Sir T. D. Acland's yacht 'Lady
St. Kilda' was the largest schooner and largest yacht belonging to the
Royal Western Yacht Club. Her complement of hands was eleven. Another
point worthy of attention is the proportion of rigs adopted: out of 43
vessels, 29 were cutters, 5 schooners, 4 yawls, 5 no rig given.</p>

<p>The regattas were held at first on the anniversary of the coronation of
His Majesty George IV., and the members were to be distinguished by a
uniform worn on the day of the regatta, and at such other times as they
might think proper.</p>

The president, the vice-presidents, and the stewards were to have three
buttons on a slash cuff, and to wear blue pantaloons.</p>

<p>The regatta takes place about September 1, when there is generally a
great meeting. About four hundred members and one hundred yachts belong
to the club. The Royal Navy contributes innumerable classes of craft to
compete in the racing, whilst the trawlers and fishing vessels all come
in for the sports, producing one of the most picturesque gatherings to
be seen anywhere. The secretary is Capt. H. Holditch, who has kindly
furnished the information here given.</p>

<h3>THE ROYAL VICTORIA YACHT CLUB, RYDE</h3>

<p>The R.V.Y.C., established in 1844, made a strong start, as the
foundation stone of the present house was laid by H.R.H. the Prince
Consort in March 1846. It is well placed close to the end of Ryde Pier,
having a commanding view of very wide range from its windows. The club
has always been noted for its encouragement of yacht racing, and has
endeavoured to bring about international contests. In 1890 a Gold
Challenge Cup was instituted, value 600 guineas, subscribed for by the
members, and the famous race for the trophy in 1893 between H.R.H. the
Prince of Wales's 'Britannia' and Mr. Carroll's 'Navahoe' will be found
described in the account of the sport which took place in that memorable
year. The R.V.Y. Club at Ryde is often called the Red Squadron, in
contradistinction to the R.Y.S. with the White Ensign.</p>

<p>In 1891 the club started regattas for the small classes which were then
becoming so prominent. These have been warmly taken up and attended with
great success.</p>

<p>There is yet another Challenge Cup in the hands of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>(p. 45)</span>
Committee, value 100 guineas. As yet it has not been sailed for, but it
is decided that the course is to be in the open Channel, not less than
150 miles, such as Ryde, round Plymouth Breakwater, Cherbourg
Breakwater, and back to Ryde for the finish. The Cup was presented by
Mr. T. B. C. West, of 'Wendur' and 'Queen Mab' fame. Probably the length
of the course has deterred competition; at least, a well-known skipper,
Captain John Nichols, who sailed 'Alarm,' 'Mosquito,' and 'Cygnet,'
always says that 'nine hours at the tiller is quite enough to do it
properly'; and his experience spreads over many years and many a tough
tussle for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>(p. 46)</span> mastery. Mr. Fife of Fairlie declares that the
'Cuckoo,' 90 tons, never showed her real capability until 'Captain John'
sailed her. The Royal Victoria Yacht Club has recently added a very
large room fronting the sea, and acquired a 'look-out' at the end of the
Pier, which seems almost like sitting in an armchair at Spithead. The
small raters have a good friend in the Secretary, Mr. Percy Thellusson,
who dearly loves them, without neglecting in any way the interests of
the larger craft.</p>

<p>An eccentric finish to a yacht race occurred in connection with this
club, in the contest for Ryde Town Purse, August 11, 1892, and other
prizes for smaller classes. There was a nice breeze from the eastward at
10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and like a flight of swans the yachts were away together. At 2
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, when off the Peel Bank, not a breath of wind was there to help
them. The committee decided to run up signal to shorten course and
conclude at the first round. No sooner was this done and carried out
than a brave westerly breeze sprang up and brought in about fifteen of
the craft, all classes together, both great and small, all with
feathered bows. The whole of the starters returned together within about
ten minutes. The uncertainty of the turf is proverbial, but the
uncertainty of the sea is no less remarkable.</p>

<p>This club, which was established in 1844, originally had its
headquarters at Liverpool, the first commodore having been Dr. Grinwood,
whose brother is now the only original member left. About 1878 the club
quarters were moved to a large house in Birkenhead, close to the river,
on the banks of which a pavilion has been constructed, as well as a
large slip and two gridirons. During the whole time the club has only
had two honorary secretaries, the past and the present. To the late
secretary, Mr. Henry Melling, we are indebted for the two illustrations
(p. 47); he drew and published them himself, much to his credit, as
valuable data showing the rig of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>(p. 47)</span> time. The annual regatta is
generally held at the latter end of June, the great drawback to
Liverpool yachting being the tides and the bar, to diminish which great
efforts are being made by dredging on an enormous scale. 1893 was the
Jubilee <span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>(p. 49)</span> Regatta. This was a great success. 'Britannia,'
'Satanita,' 'Iverna,' took part in the races, which were accompanied by
the club steamer, carrying the Commodore, Col. Gamble, C.B., and the
Hon. Secretary, Captain James Gladstone.</p>

<h3>THE ROYAL PORTSMOUTH CORINTHIAN YACHT CLUB<br>
<span class="smcap">By G. L. Blake</span></h3>

<p>What the Clyde is to Scotland, and Kingstown and Queenstown are to
Ireland, that the Solent and Southampton Water (which constitute the
waters more or less shut off from the Channel by the Isle of Wight) are
to the South of England. It is no matter of wonderment, then, that
attempts should have been made from time to time, and dating back some
generations, to form clubs which would have for their express purpose
the encouragement of seamanship, and the racing and building of yachts.</p>

<p>To many old yachtsmen the 'ups and downs' of some of these societies
which are still in existence form a history of no small interest; while
the rise, doings, and fall of those now defunct ought to teach many
valuable and important lessons to the officers and committees that are
working hard for the prosperity and welfare of present day yacht clubs.</p>

<p>The club which above all others has tended to encourage the proficiency
of amateur salts, so that they have become capable of manning,
piloting, and steering their own or their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>(p. 50)</span> friends' vessels to
glory, is the Royal Portsmouth Corinthian Yacht Club. Instituted at a
time when small-yacht sailing and amateur seamanship had little or no
patronage from the big clubs, and when no ruling spirit appeared willing
to come forward to help them on to any great degree, when the annual
local regattas of the Itchen Ferry, Ryde, and Cowes Town, Southampton,
and a few other seaside resorts, were the only opportunities afforded
for sport and racing among the small fry, perhaps no club deserves more
notice among those south of London than the one in question. Its birth
took place at a meeting held on Saturday, May 22, 1880, in the
committee-room of the Prince of Wales Club, High Street, Portsmouth,
under the patronage of the late Admiral Ryder, R.N., and General H.S.H.
Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, at that time the Commander-in-Chief and
Governor of Portsmouth, Rear-Admiral the Honourable F. A. C. Foley,
R.N., and Major-General Sir F. Fitz-Wygram, with Captain Garrett, R.A.,
in the chair. A provisional committee was elected, among whom were
Messrs. W. Gilman, C. Johnson, Thomas and Charles McCheane, F. Ruck,
R.E., W. C. Storey, W. V. Dickenson, 69th Regiment, J. Bewicke, 69th
Regiment, Colonel Savory, Admiral Hallowes, Commander Britten, R.N.,
H.M.S. 'St. Vincent,' Captains Sutton, R. Kennedy, Rasch, the Reverends
C. P. Grant, Vicar of Portsmouth, and J. F. Brown, R.C. Military
Chaplain. General Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Captain Garrett and
Captain Sutton were the first officers appointed to serve as Commodore,
Vice- and Rear-commodores, and Messrs. Gilman and C. McCheane with
Captain Kennedy undertook other duties. Among the yachts owned at that
period by the young club, the best known were the 'Vega,' 40 tons,
belonging to Captain Garrett; Mr. Gilman's little 'Zephyr,' 11 tons (for
many seasons one of the fastest of the old 12-ton class); and the 'Zoe,'
one of the most successful 21-ft. boats on the Solent, which was
fortunate in being owned and piloted by one of the best amateur helmsmen
and sailormen in the south of England&mdash;the late Mr. C. Johnson, of
Gosport.</p>

<a id="img032" name="img032"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>(p. 52)</span> At the third meeting the Yacht Racing Association rules were
adopted, while the fourth settled that very much vext and troublesome
question as to what constitutes 'a yachting amateur,' and accordingly
drew out the rule that 'No person shall be considered an amateur who has
been at any time engaged in the navigation or sailing of a yacht for
pay,' the wording of which has since been altered to the following: 'An
amateur is a gentleman who has never received pay for sailing in a
fore-and-aft vessel, officers of the Royal Navy and Mercantile Marine
excepted.' At the same meeting Mr. C. McCheane undertook the sole duties
of honorary secretary in place of Captain Kennedy.</p>

<p>On June 26, 1880, the first regatta of the newly formed club was held,
when five events were pulled off under the most favourable auspices. So
successful was this first attempt at bringing the local boats together,
that the next regatta, which was similar in its classes, brought out no
fewer than eight entries in the race for the service boats of Her
Majesty's ships, all of which were steered by naval members of the club,
with the one exception of the 'Wren,' which, it is interesting to
chronicle, was steered by Miss Foley, daughter of the Admiral commanding
the Portsmouth Steam Reserve. She was the first lady member, and one of
the first ladies&mdash;if indeed there was one before her&mdash;to pilot home the
winning yacht in a race. Now that so many ladies enter into the sport of
yacht racing and come out as famous helmswomen, the position held by
Miss Foley is one to be proud of. In the fourth race Mr. Baden-Powell's
old boat, the 'Diamond,' 5 tons, at this time owned by Messrs. Sutton,
put in an appearance as a 25-ft. boat; and in the fifth race Mr. J. H.
Baillie's 20-ft. boat 'Kate,' the earliest of Mr. Beavor Webb's outputs,
entered.</p>

</div>

<p class="clearboth">Besides periodical regattas, the club was able to take in hand a good
many matches, which were made up whenever a sufficient number of racing
yachts to create sport happened to be lying off Southsea or about the
port, and good prizes were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>(p. 53)</span> always forthcoming, for, as is the
case in the Royal Alfred Yacht Club of Kingstown, all money was devoted
at this time to racing purposes. The match held on the 14th of August,
1880, is a very fair example of what these extemporaneous races were
like. It was for yachts of 20 tons and under. The entries included:
'Madge,' 10 tons, Mr. J. Coats; 'Louise,' 20 tons; 'Euterpe,' 20 tons,
Mr. Bayley; 'Freda,' 20 tons, Mr. Freke; 'Maggie,' 15 tons, Mr. Taylor;
'Viola,' 20 tons, Mr. Kelly; 'Sayonara,' 20 tons, Mr. G. W. Richardson.
By the end of the first season the club had advanced to such a strong
position in the eyes of yachting men and in the public estimation, that
Her Majesty was pleased to accede to the request of the Commodore,
Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, to have it made a Royal club, and
accordingly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>(p. 54)</span> commanded that from May 27, 1880, the club should be
styled the Royal Portsmouth Corinthian Yacht Club. Except perhaps in the
cases of the Royal Cork, the Royal Yacht Squadron and Royal Highland, no
yachting club has ever been known to grow so rapidly into popularity as
to obtain the Royal warrant within the space of less than six months.</p>

<p>The season of 1881 began on April 6 with a yacht tonnage of 3,569 tons
and 220 members belonging to the club. The year was an important one in
its annals, for some of the best known of yachtsmen became members of
the community. Captain Garrett gave up the Vice-Commodoreship, and was
succeeded by Captain F. Sutton, late 11th Hussars, whilst Admiral Byng
undertook the office vacated by Captain Sutton.</p>

<p>The greater number of those who had up to this time joined the Royal
Portsmouth Corinthian Yacht Club were yachting members, and lived in all
parts of the United Kingdom. The opening regatta was held on the
glorious 4th of June, so dear to Eton and other memories. It witnessed
the entry, in the race for yachts of 11 to 25 tons, of that favourite
old 20-ton clipper the 'Vanessa,' and the old Fairlie 25-tonner
'Santry.' The courses this year finished between a mark-boat and the
Southsea Pier.</p>

<p>At the third regatta another famous old ship threw down the glove to the
'Gadfly' and Mr. Arthur Glennie's 'Sonata,' viz. the 16-ton 'Satanella.'
On August 13, by the special command of Her Majesty, the club had the
honour of holding its Annual Royal Regatta in Osborne Bay. The entries
were large for all the items of the programme, no fewer than twelve
boats starting in a class for 30 ft. and under, and thirty-one for the
race for centreboarders. In this last race the Prince of Wales sailed
his little crack 'Belle Lurette,' and won the second prize. In the race
for yachts of 40 tons and upwards the 'Sam&oelig;na,' 'Annasona,' and
'Sleuthhound' started. It may be stated here, that on the day of the
regatta the club had 400 names on its list of members, the greater
number of whom claimed some pretensions to being yachtsmen. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>(p. 55)</span> was a rapid increase of 180 in less than four months, and
distinctly proved that the club was already satisfactorily filling the
much-desired need on the Solent, and it was most gratifying to those who
had given their time and their energy towards the success of the venture
that nothing but praise poured in from all quarters, because of the
perfect organisation with which all regattas, matches, and general
arrangements were carried out. Perhaps it is not too much to say here
that the club owed much at this period of its existence to its honorary
secretary, the late Mr. Charles McCheane, whose unflagging zeal and
well-known gift of organisation helped to a very considerable extent to
bring about the prestige which it was beginning to enjoy.</p>

<p>One great feature of the season of 1881 was the addition of a rule
allowing any boat that had been hired by a member for a space of over
three months to enter for the club races, in order to give every
encouragement to the sport of yacht-racing. Many have been the times
that such a rule has been begged for by yachtsmen, especially tiros at
the game; but the Yacht Racing Association, and, in fact, all Royal
Yacht Clubs with the exception of the Royal Portsmouth Corinthian, have
placed a veto on any proposition which included in any way its
introduction. With the Royal Portsmouth Corinthian the rule proved in
the early days of the club a great success, but latterly, as yacht
tonnage was added to the club and members became provided with their own
ships, the rule gradually died out, till at last it has disappeared
altogether from the Book of Rules and Regulations.</p>

<p>The year 1882 was notable chiefly for the introduction of a new class in
the regatta programmes, viz. that for 3-tonners. Four of these little
vessels did battle in all kinds of weather and proved most successfully
how much power and what fine sea-going qualities can be obtained by
length and depth with almost a minimum of beam. Mr. Wynne Eyton and Mr.
Quilter designed and raced the composite built 'Mascotte,' Mr. A. W.
Courtney the 'Naiad,' the late Lord Francis Cecil the 'Chittywee,'
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>(p. 56)</span> and Lord Ailsa and Mr. Baden-Powell the 'Snarley Yow.' Of these
the 'Chittywee' was the best all-round boat, though the 'Mascotte' gave
her all she could do to beat her.</p>

<p>In the small length classes, the 20-ft. 'Kate,' which had become the
property of the Honorary Secretary during the winter of 1881, came to
the fore in a remarkable manner, saving her time when necessary, and
giving all comers a fair beating. The next year, however, witnessed her
total defeat by Mr. Popham's little 'Bird of Freedom,' a boat that is
still to the fore.</p>

<p>The Annual Royal Regatta of 1883 was held as before at Osborne Bay, and
proved a complete success, and the club could now boast of a patronage
second only to that of the Royal Yacht Squadron. The programme on August
11, the day of the regatta, exhibited a great advance on those of the
two previous years, as the classes ranged more after the fashionable
formulæ, viz. for yachts of 40 tons and under, 20 and over 14, 14 and
over 9 tons. The race for 40-ton yachts fell through, but was afterwards
sailed on August 22, when the 'Annasona,' 'Tara,' 'Sleuthhound,'
'Phryne,' and 'Silver Star' crossed the line, and 'Tara' and 'Silver
Star' (their first appearance under the flag of the Royal Portsmouth
Club) came in first and second. Among the twenties, which showed up for
the first time, were the 'Freda' and two well-known old warriors from
St. George's Channel, the 'Quickstep' and 'Challenge.' In the race for
10-tonners the 'Ulidia,' designed by Mr. W. Fife, jun., was the new
addition to the club, and she fought it out with the 'Buttercup,' this
latter favourite being thoroughly beaten on all points of sailing.</p>

<p>During the year of 1884 the prosperity of the club was decidedly on the
increase. In the first place, during the winter, the premises in the
High Street, Portsmouth, which had up to this time formed the Prince of
Wales's Club House, had been bought, altered and improved to suit the
club's requirements. As it stands now, it is one of the most comfortable
club-houses in the South of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>(p. 57)</span> The club also opened on Southsea Beach a Station House of its
own, which has telephonic communications with the house in High Street,
and all parts of the towns of Portsmouth and Southampton. It consists of
a railed-off space, sufficient to allow of a fair frontage, besides room
for the flagstaff, guns, and all such necessary fittings. The building
is a very comfortable cabin, with all modern conveniences. The
telephonic communication with Southampton is of the greatest possible
service, as most of the small raters make the Itchen and its precincts
their home.</p>

<p>On June 7 in this year, the custom (which has now died out) of having an
opening cruise under the club officers was originated. Nothing can make
up for the teaching which man&oelig;uvring under sail affords, and it is a
great pity more of such cruises do not take place, and that at regular
intervals.</p>

<p>The officers of the club had remained the same up to this year, when
Admiral Byng gave up the Rear-Commodoreship in favour of Mr. J. R. West.
One of the great features of the season was the recognition of the foot
classes, which became so popular during the following four years. The
first and second regattas introduced races for boats or yachts of 25
feet and 30 feet on the load water-line. In the latter class the
'Eclipse' and 'Keepsake' were competitors, the 'Eclipse' being the
better of the two boats; and in the former the 'Daphne,' 'Wave,' and
'Lil' were the three to race, the 'Lil' being the principal winner. The
Annual Royal Regatta, owing to the sad bereavement that had visited the
Court, took place by royal command off Bembridge, instead of in Osborne
Bay as heretofore. No fewer than fourteen items constituted the
programme, of which the most interesting was the ten-ton match between
the 'Ulidia' and 'Ulerin,' representatives of Messrs. Fife and Watson,
the great Scotch yacht designers. On August 16 a fine match was brought
off, and the amateurs' powers put to the test, when 'A Corinthian
Plate,' a very handsome piece of silver work, weighing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>(p. 58)</span> 134
ozs., was sailed for by the 'Genesta,' 'Marguerite,' and 'Irex.'</p>

<p>Perhaps the most sporting matches that have been sailed under the red
burgee with crown, star, and half-moon in centre, were three that sprang
out of a race for yachts of 20 tons and under, and took place at the
last regatta of the season. On this occasion the 'Enriqueta,' 20-ton
(cutter that was, but at this time a) yawl, snatched, by some few
seconds on time allowance, first honours from the old 'Quickstep.' On
the Monday following the regatta a friendly match was sailed between the
two vessels, ending with the same result as on the Saturday. Two matches
were then arranged to be sailed on the next and following days, the
conditions of which were that amateurs alone were to man one yacht,
while professionals were to take charge of the other. No pilot was to be
allowed, and the prize was to be 1<i>l.</i> from each amateur should the
professionals win, and a sixpenny pipe from each professional should the
amateurs be successful. Lots to be drawn for the choice of yacht in the
first race, yachts to be exchanged for the second.</p>

<p>The result of the lots on the Tuesday gave the amateurs the choice of
ships, and they took the 'Enriqueta.' The course was across an imaginary
line from the Signal Station flagstaff to the mark-boat, round the Spit
buoy, Warner Lightship and East Sturbridge buoy, leaving all on the
starboard hand, thence round the Spit buoy and mark-boat on port hand,
to finish between the mark-boat on port hand and Signal Station. Twice
round, 20 miles.</p>

<a id="img035" name="img035"></a>

</div>

<p>The wind was light from the south-east. The professionals in the
'Quickstep' were the first over the line, but it was before the gun
fired, and they had to recross it. This was not taken advantage of by
the 'Enriqueta,' for the yacht, just as the gun fired, was, for some
unaccountable reason, kept in irons quite two minutes by her helmsman.
The 'Enriqueta' was steered by her owner and Major Urquhart. The
'Quickstep' won by 12 mins. 13 secs. On the following day the
conditions were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>(p. 59)</span> identical, except that the yachts were
exchanged. The tide, wind, and weather were the same as on the Tuesday.
Both yachts crossed the line at the same time. 'Enriqueta' held the
weather berth, and, hugging the mark-boat, went about at once; but
'Quickstep,' by a very pretty piece of steering on the part of Mr.
Maxwell Heron, was put about and brought on 'Enriqueta's' weather.
'Enriqueta' got away again under 'Quickstep's' lee, owing to the latter
having her sails too closely pinned in. This error was fortunately
rectified, and the 'Quickstep,' with sheets slightly checked, at once
sprang ahead and forereached on the yawl, but not sufficiently to
prevent the 'Enriqueta,' when off Southsea Castle, from going about and
crossing 'Quickstep's' bow, a proceeding which, had it not been for the
fine helmsmanship displayed, must have ended in a collision. When the
yawl tacked the next time, however, the 'Quickstep' was to windward once
more, and led round the Warner Lightship by 4 mins. The mark-boat was
rounded at the end of the first round by the 'Quickstep' 14 mins. 15
secs. ahead of the 'Enriqueta.' On the second round the wind fell light,
shifting and flukey, and, except that the 'Quickstep' won, offered no
very interesting points of sailing worth noting. Such matches as the
foregoing are worth repeating; for it is when acting in competition with
men who make fore-and-aft sailing their business that amateurs find out
the value of their seafaring knowledge, and can accordingly gauge their
strength and learn to amend their weak points.</p>

<p>In 1885 the first regatta&mdash;and regattas now took place once a fortnight
regularly&mdash;was memorable for the maiden races of the 'Elma' among the
service boats, and the 'Syren' in the 25-ft. class. The 'Elma' had been
an open whale-shaped admiral's barge. She was rigged with dipping lugs,
and manned by sub-lieutenants from H.M.S. 'Excellent.' The writer had
the privilege of seeing her work her way to Bembridge late in the
season, and the smart manner in which the boat was handled, and the lugs
lowered, dipped, and hoisted, was one of the prettiest sights of the
season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>(p. 60)</span> The second regatta witnessed the <i lang="fr">début</i> of the two latest
additions to the 30-ft. class&mdash;the 'Curtsey' and 'Yum Yum.' The
'Curtsey' proved herself the best boat of her year.</p>

<p>It was during this year that the new A, B, C classes were, for the first
time, given a prominent place in the regatta programmes. These severally
were supposed to include the full-blown racer, the out-of-date racer,
and the ordinary cruiser. The idea was to try to create a method by
which all yacht-owners might have an opportunity of joining in yacht
racing. The system proved only a partial success, and the real gainers
by the innovation, if there were any, were the sailmakers, who were kept
employed, owing to many an 'old box' requiring spinnakers and other
light muslin quite foreign to their original sail-plan.</p>

<p>The fourth regatta of the season took place away from the port, and off
the new watering-place, Lee-on-Solent. The principal course started from
over an imaginary line lying between the committee vessel and a
flagstaff at Lee-on-Solent, round the north-east and east Middle buoy,
the west Middle buoy, round the Bramble buoys, omitting the Thorn,
Calshot Lightship, and Hill Head buoy, to pass between the committee
vessel and shore, leaving all marks on the starboard hand; three times
round.</p>

<p>On July 25, the first club match round the Isle of Wight took place. It
was open to all yachts of 9 tons and upwards in the B and C classes. Two
of Fairlie's old clippers came out in new feathers for this race, the
'Neptune' and 'Fiona'; and the former not only in this, but in many
another thrash round a course during this and the following seasons,
kept well in the van and showed that age had in no way been detrimental
to her speed. The Royal Regatta was again held off Bembridge on August
8, when for the 10-tonners' prize the 'Queen Mab,' and in the 5-ton
class the pretty 'Cyprus,' showed their wonderful weatherly qualities.
The day is one that will long be remembered by those who took part in
the trips round the Nab. The course, for all the classes from 5 tons
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>(p. 61)</span> upwards, was from an imaginary line between the committee
boat and H.M.S. 'Speedy,' round the Warner Lightship, the Dean Tail buoy
and Nab Lightship, leaving all to starboard, to finish between the
committee vessel on the port hand and the 'Speedy'; twice round. The
weather was boisterous, with half a gale of wind blowing from the
southward and westward. There was a nasty cross sea off the Nab, which
frightened more than one hardy salt from making a start, and the owners
of the 30-ft. yachts did their best to have their course shortened. The
only accident, which might have turned out disastrous, was the capsizing
of the 'Elma,' when making a board off the Nab Lightship. She was,
however, righted, bailed out, and one by one all her crew got on board.</p>

<p class="clearboth">The next year (1886) exhibited a still further advance in the well-being
of the club. The number of regattas during the season was increased from
eight to ten, exclusive of matches and the annual Royal Regatta, which
this year took place at Stokes Bay. Numerous new and old yachts were
added to the club tonnage, for the B and C classes began to fill, and
many a forgotten old heroine was made to come out and don her
long-left-off racing suits. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>(p. 62)</span> Of those which thus appeared all
spick and span were the 'May,' 40 tons; 'Foxhound,' 35 tons; 'Veronica,'
92 tons; 'Terpsichore,' 38 tons; 'Leander' and 'Nadejola,' twenties; and
'Naiad' and 'Lily,' old Mersey tens. Of the new yachts the 'Hyacinth'
was the fruit of the new classification, as she was designed and built
by Mr. Arthur Payne, to race in the B class. This was the last year that
any yachts were built to the 25-ft. and 21-ft. classes, the 'Verena,' 25
ft., and the 'Minima,' and 'Volador,' 21 ft., being the last that were
laid down on the stocks.</p>

<p>The number of members up to this date had been steadily on the increase,
so that by the end of the year the list had reached over 600. Since the
club had started in 1880, over 73 regattas and matches had been held,
and more than 2,600<i>l.</i> given in prizes&mdash;a past history such as few, if
any, of the older clubs can show.</p>

<p>In 1887 the Yacht Racing Association rating rule came into force, and
though some races were provided for the 25-ft. class, still the main
racing was among the A, B, and C and rater classes. The 'Thalassa' and
'Stella' were the first representatives of the 2&frac12;-raters, the
'Sybil,' 26 tons, and 'Mary,' 25 tons, coming out to wrest the prizes
from the 'Hyacinth.'</p>

<p>The next year it was found quite impossible to suit all owners so as to
fill every event on a programme. This was owing to there still being a
tonnage class, A, B and C, the new rating and the length classes. The
consequence was that only seven regattas came off during the season,
exclusive of the Royal Regatta, which was again held at Bembridge.
During the season of 1888, the question of shifting keels was brought
before the club committee, and a hard fight was made to have them
abolished. There was the same curious assortment of classes as in the
preceding year, because the rating rule had not as yet taken hold of the
yacht-racing public.</p>

<p>By 1889 so great had become the popularity of the club and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>(p. 63)</span> the
demand for membership that it was decided to raise the annual
subscription to 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>, with an entrance fee of 5<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> for
non-yacht-owners, and 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> for yacht-owners. The rating classes
had now come into full swing, and the season started with a match for
20-raters, unique, in that it brought together no fewer than five newly
launched competitors, viz.: the 'Chiqueta,' 'Dragon,' 'Ghost,' 'Siola,'
and 'Velzie.' By the third regatta eight 2&frac12;-raters were ready for the
fray, seven of which were new boats that season&mdash;'Cock-a-whoop,'
'Cosette,' 'Humming Bird,' 'Madcap,' 'Nadador,' 'Heathen Chinee,' and
'Musume.' Among the 10-raters were the old 5-ton flyer 'Doris,' now
swelled out to meet the more modern school, 'Fantan,' 'Dis,' 'Decima,'
and 'Ethel.' The new 'Blue Belle,' 'Tar Baby,' and sometimes the
'Thief,' formed the 5-rating class.</p>

<p>The event of the season was the handicap race for the Cup given by the
Queen, which took place on August 10. It was open to yachts of 20 tons
and over, and 17 started. The course chosen lay to the eastward, from an
imaginary line between the flagstaff on the Spit Fort, and the committee
boat, round the Nab Lightship, west buoy of the middle and committee
vessel, leaving all on the starboard hand, to finish between the
committee vessel and the Spit buoy. There was a strong south-westerly
breeze blowing all day, which suited the large yachts well, and some of
the finest sailing of the year was witnessed by those who were fortunate
enough to follow the race.</p>

<p>Nothing of note occurred during the 1890 period of the club's history.
The match which took place on August 2, for yachts rated at 40 tons and
over, was the most successful of the season, for it brought together all
the large cracks of the year, viz. the 'Iverna,' 119, 'Thistle,' 120,
'Valkyrie,' 76, and 'Yarana,' 72. The 5-rater class proved a very full
one, the leading yacht architects sending out as representatives of
their skill the 'Valentine,' 'Glycera,' 'Quinque,' 'Alwida,' 'Archee,'
and 'Fair Geraldine.' The 2&frac12;-rater class <span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>(p. 64)</span> received as new
additions the 'Troublesome,' 'Babe,' 'Janetta,' 'Dolphin,' 'Camilla,'
and 'G.G.' A class, however, which gave a fund of amusement, and was
allowed a place in the club's programmes for the first time this year,
was the &frac12;-rater. No fewer than ten little boats formed its racing
fleet, and were always ready to cross the line whenever a prize and race
were offered them.</p>

<p>In 1891 these mosquitoes had a Champion Cup presented to them by Mr.
Blair Cochrane, and eleven started at the third regatta of the season
for this trophy, which was won by the little 'Kittiwake,' the 'Coquette'
coming in second. Another new class, for 1-raters, was started this
year, but only four competitors composed it, among them being the
'Kelpie,' 'Sam&oelig;na,' and 'Unit.' The Royal Regatta was held at Wootton
Creek on August 8, and the annual race round the Island was perhaps the
best race of the season. It will be seen that, after the rating rule
came into force, racing among old cast-offs found no further favour in
the eyes of the community, and as an example of the modern programme,
the following on the next page, which is that of the Royal Regatta, is a
very good specimen.</p>

<p>Of the sailing committee, which has done so much good work, there are
names that have appeared on its list as serving members almost from the
time a sailing committee was first formed. Capt. Sutton, the honoured
Vice-Commodore, and Mr. Gilman, the Hon. Treasurer, deserve first
mention, as they have been office-holders from the foundation of the
club, and Mr. Gilman's name appears in the earliest committee list.
Admiral Hallowes and Major Bulkeley are next in order of seniority.
Capt. Hayes, R.N., Messrs. Crampton and A. H. Glennie (the latter is the
present Rear-Commodore) follow in order, while Capt. Nottage, Messrs.
Flemmich, Laity, Walford, and Wildy bring up the rear. The membership of
a sailing committee of such a club as the Royal Portsmouth Corinthian is
no sinecure, and a man must be a keen yachtsman who will undertake the
duties entailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>(p. 66)</span> That the naval officers who are honorary members have been
valued friends to the club goes without saying. Nothing could exceed the
interest that has been taken in the club's welfare by the Commodore,
H.S.H. General Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, especially whilst in
command at Portsmouth. Neither must the club's mainstay, the honorary
secretary, Mr. John Main, be forgotten. Almost from the beginning Mr.
Main had acted as under-secretary to the then honorary secretary, Mr. C.
McCheane, and it is not too much to say that when acting in that
capacity he was the kedge anchor to the club, and frequently on
occasions was called upon to play the part of best bower. When Mr.
McCheane resigned his office on July 14, 1887, after an interregnum of
three months, during which Captain Haldane was made acting secretary,
Mr. Main was chosen unanimously to fill the vacant office, and not only
those connected with the club, but all who have had to hold
communication with him, know how well its arduous duties have been
performed. It is to this gentleman that the writer is indebted for help
in compiling this notice.</p>

<p>With a commodious house, a signal station to keep up, and prizes to be
provided (nearly 6,000<i>l.</i> have been given to be sailed for up to 1893),
the expenses, it is needless to say, are great and tax the funds
considerably. Money, however, is always forthcoming through the
liberality displayed by many of the members. Among those who have come
forward to help the club with gifts of cups and prizemoney are the
following gentlemen, whose names are rarely absent from any notice or
list calling for an extra supply towards the prize fund: Captain Sutton,
Vice-Commodore; Mr. J. R. West, late Rear-Commodore; Mr. A. H. Glennie,
Rear-Commodore; and Messrs. Julian Senior, S. Richards, and B. Paget.
Mrs. Robertson Fernie makes an annual present of a purse in memory of
her late husband, who was always a contributor up to the time of his
death.</p>

<p>The club has certainly done more for amateur seamanship than any other
inside the Isle of Wight; it was the first to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>(p. 67)</span> start a system of
fortnightly regattas, and has always been chosen by outside clubs to
time the arrivals of their ocean races to the port of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The usual annual regatta was held last year, 1893, somewhat
unfortunately, during the squadron week at Cowes, whither the big
cutters of the season had attracted so many lovers of yacht racing as
well as general sight-seers. A very varied programme was provided,
including all classes from the 100-tonner to the &frac12;-rater, in all about
five different races. The first was a handicap for yachts exceeding
19-rating, the course being from between the committee-vessel and the
Spit Fort, round the N.E. middle buoy, Warner lightship, and Boyne buoy,
all marks to be left on the port hand. This afforded a great opportunity
for the spectators on Southsea beach to see the racing thoroughly well,
as the competitors had to accomplish three rounds, making about a
40-mile course.</p>

<p>The object of handicaps is to get sport amongst craft of varied tonnage,
class, and build, by giving time allowance. In the present case the
largest vessel was 'Mabel,' late 'Irex,' 100-rating; the
smallest,'Marigold,' 22-rating; 'Mabel' allowing 'Marigold' 39 minutes.
Six started. A good race ensued, as the following time of the finish
will corroborate:&mdash;'Columbine,' winner, 4 hrs. 32 mins. 41 secs.;
'Castanet,' 2nd prize, 4 hrs. 36 mins. 15 secs.; 'Creole,' 3rd prize, 4
hrs. 33 mins. 43 secs.; 'Mabel,' 4 hrs. 38 mins. 14 secs.</p>

added its share. The arrival time round Boulogne mark-boat is worth

<p>The E.N.E. was now a little before their beam; with flattened sheets
they all began to dive a little more than on the voyage out. At last,
some five miles or so after rounding the Boulogne mark-boat, the leading
schooner, 'Phantom,' took a dive that was too much for her bowsprit,
which snapped off short. Poor 'Phantom,' in the prime of life, leading
grandly and full of promise! After this there were no more accidents.
The 'Australia' had the lead, and finished, winning the 100<i>l.</i> prize,
and establishing a record, 4 hrs. 12 mins. 40 secs. for the course,
which has not been beaten up to the present.</p>

<p>1824. Northern Yacht Club Seal.</p>
</div>

<p>The Clyde is, and always has been, the great yachting nursery and centre
of the North. The very mention of the name arouses all who have
pleasurable recollections of the great waters which lead up to the
narrow Clutha, whence emerged those monsters of the deep, 'Lucanias,'
and other triumphs of modern science. As recently as 1886 the steamer
'Industry,' built by Fife of Fairlie in 1814, was lying in the mud at
Haulbowline, after running some sixty years between Greenock and
Glasgow. Yacht-building has always been vigorously carried on in the
Great Estuary for three generations. The Fifes of Fairlie have designed
and built grand vessels there, though the flat shore presents immense
difficulties, which are greatly added to by the present increase of
draught and lead ballast in yachts of all classes.</p>

<p>The Royal Northern Yacht Club is installed at that delightful spot,
Rothesay, noted for its fine bay; and though Clyde weather is known to
yachting men as being somewhat impulsive and petulant, whipping out
spars, destructive to balloon canvas unless the skipper is very
weatherwise indeed, still for real sailing the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>(p. 74)</span> Clyde affords
some of the best courses in the world and the grandest sport from
23-footers to 200-tonners.</p>

<p class="smcap">ROYAL NORTHERN YACHT CLUB, ROTHESAY.</p>
</div>

<p>The Royal Northern Club had a very interesting origin. It dates from
1824, when it was founded by some gentlemen in the north of Ireland and
west of Scotland who were devotees of yachting. A few years later the
club was separated into two branches, an Irish and Scotch division, as
will be perceived by the flags given here in illustration. One has the
shamrock wreath, the other the thistles, each division having its own
committee and officials.</p>

<p>Royal Northern flags.</p>
</div>

<p>The records of the Scotch division prior to 1846 were unfortunately
destroyed by an accident some years ago. The minute-book of the Irish
division has, however, survived. From it we find that at a meeting of
gentlemen interested in the foundation of the Northern Yacht Club, held
at Belfast on November 5, 1824, it was resolved 'that the establishment
of a yacht club is a highly desirable object.' A committee was
accordingly appointed to that end, Mr. Robert Thomson being requested to
act as secretary, and at a general meeting held April 8, 1825, Mr. John
Allan of Glasgow accepted the post of secretary for the Clyde. At a
general meeting at Belfast May 2, 1825, the secretary was instructed to
write to Mr. Allan, to consult <span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75"></a>(p. 75)</span> with the Scotch members and fix
with them the place of rendezvous for the first general meeting of the
boats of the club. The date arranged was the first Monday in June, and
the Irish members declared that they were ready to meet the Scotch
members 'in any part of the Clyde' on that day.</p>

<p>The club was known as the Northern Yacht Club. There is no record in the
minute-book of the burgee adopted, but in an old picture, now in the
club-house at Rothesay, the yachts are shown cruising off Garroch Head,
in the Clyde, with red ensigns, the burgee also red, with the letters
N.Y.C. in white. The present secretary has courteously sent a photograph
of this picture, also of the flags, as an historical contribution. The
first prizes offered were for pulling (rowing) matches to take place in
Ireland.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Donegall was the first President of the club, and Mr.
Thos. Pottinger, Admiral for 1825.</p>

<p>The full dress of the club consisted of a blue coat with crimson silk
lining, with 'Marall's' vest, white or black pantaloons or breeches, and
silk stockings to correspond. Members who appeared at the dinners of
the club <span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>(p. 76)</span> without this dress were fined 10s. At a general meeting
held at Greenock, on August 3, 1825, Mr. James Hamilton, of Holmhead,
was appointed Admiral for the ensuing year.</p>

<p class="clearboth">In May 1826, at Belfast, the yachts were divided into three classes:&mdash;</p>

<table class="auto" border="0" cellpadding="2" summary="Classes.">

</table>

<p>The first regatta took place at Belfast, June 20, 21, 22, and on June 23
pulling races were rowed by members and their friends. On June 24 the
yachts were to sail together 'in a fleet,' and 'man&oelig;uvre under the
directions of the Admiral.' This is quite an echo of the Cork Water 1720
Club.</p>

<p>A proposal of the Scottish members to separate the Club into two
distinct branches was agreed to on May 16, 1827. It was probably after
this date that each division had a distinguishing burgee; from an old
print of these flags now in the club-house at Rothesay, the Irish
division seems to have flown a red burgee with a harp, the Scottish
division being distinguished by a lion in white.</p>

<p>H.M. King William IV. became Patron of the club in September 1830, and
from that time it was known as the Royal Northern Yacht Club.</p>

<p>In 1831 the yachts of the Club were arranged in classes as under:&mdash;</p>

<p>A two days' regatta was held at Belfast in 1836. The different classes
just described were started at an interval of half an hour between
each, beginning at 10.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, the prize <span class="pagenum"><a id="page77" name="page77"></a>(p. 77)</span> for each class being
ten sovereigns. On the second day a very important event took place, the
race for the Belfast Cup, value 100<i>l.</i>, a time race for all sizes.
Eight vessels to start, or no race. Entry 3<i>l.</i>; the second yacht to
save her stake. It is to be regretted that the details of this race
cannot be given. On May 21, 1838, at a meeting held of the few remaining
members of the Irish division, it was resolved to dissolve that half of
the Club and hand over any funds (they amounted to 14<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>)
to the secretary of the Scottish division.</p>

</div>

<p>It is unfortunate that the records of the Scottish division and of the
Royal Northern Club, after the dissolution and prior to 1846, have been
lost. It had prospered much. The Clyde was developing rapidly and with
great energy, as is shown by their four days' Regatta in 1835, the first
day at Helensburgh, the second at Greenock, the third at Dunoon, the
fourth at Largs, which is without doubt one of the most enthusiastic of
yachting stations.</p>

<p>It would be well to record here the cracks of the Clyde in 1835. The
'Gleam' (see <a href="#img046">illustration</a> on next page), Falcon, 'Nymph' and 'Clarence,'
were very leading craft.</p>

<p>Clyde yachting was now firmly established; Largs, Gourock, Greenock,
Dunoon, Helensburgh, Rothesay, were the stations most frequented, and
each successive season brings them forward more prominently, with
well-sustained reputation.</p>

<p>The present club-house at Rothesay was built in 1878, and the Royal
Northern Yacht Club regattas are naturally always now held at that
place, started from the Commodore's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page78" name="page78"></a>(p. 78)</span> yacht which is moored off
Craigmore for that purpose. A chart of the course is given, showing the
whole set of different distances.</p>

<p>The prominent feature of this club is that it has from a very early
period of its history had a club yacht, which is open to hire by members
for periods not exceeding a fortnight, and fine vessels they have from
time to time chosen. The first was the well-known 'Orion,' then came
'Mosquito,' a grand iron boat built in 1848, designed by Waterman, and
now a pilot boat doing good work. 'Æolus' came next. In 1885 the club
had their present vessel, the 'Ailsa,' 66 tons, built by Fife of
Fairlie; and who better could have been chosen?</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that Mr. John Allan, of Glasgow, was the
first secretary for the Clyde, 1825. Mr. E. F. Donald is the present
secretary.</p>

<h3>ROYAL CLYDE YACHT CLUB<br>
<span class="smcap">By G. L. Blake</span></h3>

<p>The history of the Royal Clyde Yacht Club affords one more proof of the
old belief that slow and steady progress is the most enduring.</p>

<p>It is now nearly forty years since the following very modest
announcement, under the heading 'Clyde Model Yacht Club,' appeared in
the 'Glasgow Herald,' of August 28, 1856:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">
     A number of gentlemen connected with yachting propose to
     form a club under the above designation, with the view of
     furthering a greater amount of emulation amongst the
     proprietors of small yachts. It is proposed to take in
     yachts under 8 tons only, being the smallest acknowledged by
     the Royal Northern Yacht Club, and to have an annual
     regatta, to be held in rotation at the various
     watering-places along the coast.</p>

<p>In answer to this call a meeting was held shortly after at the Globe
Hotel, Glasgow, on which occasion about thirty-one gentlemen entered
their names on the club's list as members. Messrs. Jas. Gilchrist,
Archibald Kennedy, Richard Ferguson, Jas. Mum, J. Gibson, Jas. Spencer,
Jas. Sutherland, and W. Kennedy were chosen to form the first committee
and draw up a code of rules, Mr. W. Kennedy acting as secretary and
treasurer.</p>

<p>At a general meeting held the following month, September, the late Mr.
Jas. Smith, of Jordan Hill, was elected first Commodore, and Mr. Tom
Holdsworth Vice-Commodore, and before the end of the year the little
club boasted some fifty members.</p>

<a id="img049" name="img049"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/img049.jpg">
<img src="images/img049tb.jpg" width="300" height="483" alt="" title=""></a>
<p class="smcap">ROYAL CLYDE YACHT CLUB<br> HUNTER'S QUAY. EST. 1856.</p>
</div>

<p>On January 27, 1857, the Admiralty warrant was granted, allowing the
club to fly the blue ensign with their burgee: blue with a red lion on a
yellow shield in centre. Measuring officers were told off, who had to
deal with the old Thames Rule of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>(p. 81)</span> measurement, excepting in the
method of taking the length, the club rule being that 'the length must
be taken from outside of the stem to the outside of the sternpost at
half the depth of each from the load water-line.' A curious provision
was made, too, with regard to racing flags. The club had a series of
flags numbered from 1 to 10, and each yacht was provided with a number
according to priority of entry for a race, but this kindly
thoughtfulness on the part of the ruling powers did not continue beyond
a couple of seasons, and members had to provide racing flags for
themselves, as they have done ever since.</p>

<p>Though an opening and other cruises had been held, together with a small
meeting at Largs, the first great event of the Clyde Model Yacht Club
took place on August 29, 1857, off Helensburgh, when four items made up
the programme, and Captain Small, Messrs. James Rowan, James Gilchrist,
Robert Hart, Dan Buchanon and Thomas Falconer did duty as the sailing
committee. The Commodore's yacht 'Wave' was moored off the baths for the
occasion, and the course chosen was from the Commodore round the Shoal
buoy&mdash;thence round a flag boat moored off Ardmore Point and back round
the Commodore's yacht, leaving all on the port hand; twice round for the
first and second races, and once round for the third and fourth.</p>

<p>The first race was for yachts of 8 tons and under, and for this the
'Fairy Queen,' 8 tons, Mr. Grant, junior; 'Armada,' 7&frac12; tons, Mr.
Dickie; 'Bella,' 8 tons, Mr. Walker; and 'Maud,' 8 tons, Mr. St. Clair
Byrne, sailed, and finished in the order given.</p>

<p>In the second face for yachts of 6 tons and under, the 'Pearl,' 4&frac12;
tons, Mr. Ferguson; 'Maria,' 5 tons, Mr. R. Lyall; 'Leda,' 6 tons, Mr.
Alexander Finlay; 'Comet,' 5 tons, Mr. Steven; and 'Clutha,' 5 tons, Mr.
Spencer, entered, the three first coming in as named.</p>

<p>The third race, for yachts of 4 tons and under, brought four competitors
together&mdash;the 'Francis,' 3&frac12; tons, Mr. Miller; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>(p. 82)</span> 'Lily,' 3&frac12;
tons, Mr. Ure; 'Echo,' 2&frac12; tons, Mr. Sutherland; and the 'Banshee,' 4
tons, Mr. Taylor. The 'Francis' won, followed home in the order as
above. The fourth item was for boats of 19 ft. over all, a class which,
though developed almost out of recognition, has always remained a firm
favourite.</p>

<p>It may here be noted that an attempt made at the close of the season to
introduce the American 'sail area' rule of measurement signally failed.</p>

<p>Between the years 1857 and 1862 little of importance took place.</p>

<p>During 1863 the first symptoms of a break out from bounds was exhibited,
and prizes were given for a race for yachts of 25 tons and under,
besides one for yachts of 10 tons and under. A stipulation was made with
regard to the latter race&mdash;viz. that each yacht was to be manned by one
hand only, a dangerous though sporting condition which had previously
brought disaster and proved fatal in Irish waters, and has never been
permitted since. Both races filled, Mr. Fulton's 'Glide,' 14 tons, won
the first, and Mr. McIver's 'Brenda,' 8 tons, the second.</p>

<p>With this divergence from the original scheme on which the club was
founded the society threw off its old name and came out under the more
independent title of the Clyde Yacht Club. To celebrate this era the
annual regatta was lengthened out to a two days' programme, and the
'Lesbia,' 37, cutter; 'Reverie,' 41, schooner; 'Kilmeny,' 30, cutter,
and 'Dawn,' yawl, met to do battle with the 15-ton 'Torch,' the crack of
the year. Besides the annual regatta, at which yachts from all parts of
the kingdom were invited to compete, the Corinthian regatta of the club
must not be lost sight of or hidden away behind the lustre of the great
event of the season. It had formed part of each season's programme of
events for some years, and had been the means of cultivating a true
taste for amateur seamanship. Many a member can look back to his first
Corinthian race as the beginning of his practical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>(p. 83)</span> experience in
yacht racing. The races at these regattas have been mostly handicaps,
and two or three are always open to yachts in cruising trim. The only
conditions of the regatta are that 'Yachts may carry their ordinary paid
hands, but no extra paid hands, and must be steered by members of a
yacht club.'</p>

<p>It is always pleasant to meet with names which are as well known as the
club to which they belong, to whom their club owes much, and whose pride
and interests are centred in its prosperity. It was in 1863 that two
such members' names were added to the official list&mdash;the late Mr. J. A.
Lockett as Rear-Commodore and Mr. William York as treasurer. Both these
gentlemen have for the last thirty years been busily engaged in
furthering the welfare of the club, the one in his capacity as secretary
or treasurer, or both, the other in several offices, but principally as
one of the house committee.</p>

<p>When the year 1867 closed the Clyde Yacht Club's first racing decade,
the club was well under way and able to hold its own with any existing
yacht-racing community, both as a provider of sport and for the
attractions offered to the lovers of yachts and yachting, when with
their friends they were brought together on the waters of the 'Bonny
Clyde.' This was noticeable in 1863, but it became much more so in 1865,
when the well-known clippers 'Mosquito,' 59 tons; 'Glance,' 35 tons;
'Fiona,' 78 tons; and the 'Vindex,' 44 tons, came round to the Firth to
sail under the Clyde Club's auspices.</p>

<p>Though opening and closing cruises had always been in vogue since the
foundation of the club, it was left for the tenth year to start the long
series of these expeditions, which last from a Thursday to the Monday
morning following, and, with the combined attractions of racing,
cruising and social gatherings, have proved such pleasant features in
each season's yachting. The list of members had now reached over 100,
while the yacht tonnage had risen to 1,200 gross, comprising 87 yachts
of 5 to 103 tons. Among these were included the three most successful
yachts of the year in the United Kingdom, and, to the praise of the
Clyde shores it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>(p. 84)</span> may be said, all built and designed by Mr. W.
Fife of Fairlie&mdash;the 'Fiona' in the 1st, the 'Kilmeny' in the 2nd, and
the 'Torch' in the 3rd class.</p>

<p>The season of 1868 would have passed without note or comment had it not
been that the club founded an annual Corinthian match, in which two paid
hands were to be allowed for yachts of 15 tons and over, and one paid
hand to all the smaller yachts. The helmsman was to be an amateur, and
no <em>shot-bag or shifting ballast</em> of any kind was to be permitted.
Besides proving that the club possessed amateur seamen capable of
handling a racing yacht of any size, the fact that that unseaworthy
equipment shifting ballast, which had been in use in the Clyde foot
classes and in most racing yachts during the early Fifties, was to be
abolished, at all events in this race, was a move in the right
direction.</p>

<p>1869 is a year of real historical importance, for it not only gives the
date when the 40-, 20-, and 10-ton classes became generally
acknowledged, but it brings credit to the Clyde Yacht Club where credit
is due, as being the founder of these classes, which held sway for so
many years. A year later the club was the first to introduce the smaller
class of 5 tons as a standing dish in its regatta programmes, and to the
Clyde Yacht Club belongs the honour of being the first in the field to
recognise that this diminutive class of flyers was well worthy on its
own merits of being encouraged.</p>

<p class="smcap">THE START FOR ARDRISHAIG CUP.</p>
</div>

<p>Channel matches had been long ere this time a matter of annual interest
with some of the clubs in the south of England, as well as the Royal
Alfred Yacht Club at Kingstown, and Royal Northern in Scotland; but the
sport of Channel racing and open-sea work had either not been thought
of, or had met with no favour, for the first Channel match held in
connection with the Clyde Club did not take place till 1871. The race
came off after the regatta held that year at Barrow and before the Clyde
regattas, the course being from Barrow to the Clyde, so that the yachts
about to visit and race in the Firth might find it worth their while to
put on a spurt and make the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>(p. 85)</span> best of their way to their
destination. No better course could be chosen for trying a vessel on all
points of sailing, to say nothing of her sea-going powers, including as
it does the passage between the Isle of Man and the Mull of Galloway.
For this race the 'Enid,' 57 tons; 'Livonia,' 280; 'Glance,' 35; and
'Coralie,' 35, started, all yachts at that date as racers. The 'Glance'
saved her time and carried off the trophy.</p>

<p>If 1871 opened up Channel groping under racing trim, 'progress' must
truly be held the motto for 1872. Not only was the club made a Royal
club, and allowed the privilege of placing a crown over the lion's head
in the burgee crest, but early in the spring of this year the Royal
Clyde opened to its members the house which Mr. Hunter, of Hafton, had
built for them at Hunter's Quay adjoining the hotel.</p>

<p>Of course with a settled headquarters, Hunter's Quay became the future
rendezvous for all club fixtures, such as opening and closing cruises,
regattas, matches and the like; and as the opening cruise this year may
be considered the first general meeting of members afloat off the new
house, it will not be amiss to give a short description of it. The
meeting took place on Thursday, May 30, and began at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> with a lunch
at the club-house, after which at 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the yachts weighed anchor under
the Commodore, and sailed under his orders till the signal was made from
the flagship for them to make the best of their way to Rothesay. On
arrival there, those who were not required on board their vessels to
stow sails and clear up for the night took their dinghies ashore, or
were taken in their gigs, for a stroll through the old town. In the
meantime on board the yachts, as soon as the decks had been cleared up
and ropes coiled down in their places, the galley fires were lighted, so
that by 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the men had had their tea, and the cooks and stewards
were ready with goodly repasts awaiting the coming on board again of the
hungry masters and their friends.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the pleasures of the evening began with what <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>(p. 86)</span> is
known as 'ship-visiting'&mdash;that is, the yacht-owner starts off, and
either rows himself and friends in his dinghy, or is rowed in correct
form, to some friend's yacht where he may remain, or, after a short
visit, proceed, taking with him his host and as many of his friends as
he can pack away in the gig's stern-sheets, to some other yacht, and so
on <i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. To row himself is much the better plan, since it
means independence of the crew (which perhaps may consist only of one
hand), and avoidance of a troubled conscience, that the man or men are
being kept up and prevented from turning in.</p>

<p>The following morning only a few burgees were visible, most of the
yachts having donned their silken racing flags, for an early start had
to be made in a handicap race to be sailed <i lang="la">viâ</i> the Garroch Head (the
most south-westerly extremity of the Isle of Bute) to Tignabruich. More
than half the yachts were started in this race, for which four cups were
provided as prizes. The contingent of small non-racers made Tignabruich
by way of the Kyles of Bute, as did also some of the larger sailing
yachts, which preferred calm and untroubled travelling to a dusting
round the Garroch Head. The gathering at the head of the Kyles is, if
anything, more enjoyable than that spent at Rothesay. The anchorage is
more land-locked, and therefore less liable to disturbance from winds or
sweeping seas, and ship-visiting can be carried on without any fear of a
ducking or other unpleasantness.</p>

<p>On the Saturday morning, the members of the club and their friends
breakfasted together at 9.30 at the Royal Hotel, when the prizes were
presented to the winners; after which a few returned to their yachts,
got under way, and dispersed with the object of extending their cruise,
while those left behind remained to enjoy the beautiful scenery and
walks with which the locality abounds, and on Sunday attend church
parade on board Lord Glasgow's yacht.</p>

</div>

<p>Beyond the adoption by the club of the Royal Alfred Yacht Club rules and
regulations, nothing of any moment worth chronicling took place till
1875, in which year the purchase <span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>(p. 87)</span> was completed by the club of
the whole of the grounds and buildings, including the hotel and
club-house, and early in 1876 the members enjoyed the privilege of not
only having a club-house, but also an establishment worked on the
principle of a private hotel, where they could provide themselves and
their families or friends with comfortable quarters on very reasonable
club terms.</p>

<p>In this matter the Royal Clyde Yacht Club is specially fortunate, as
also in one other, viz. the magnificent scenic setting by which their
possession is surrounded. Nothing can equal the Holy Loch for beauty and
charm of colour, on a summer's evening, particularly about sunset, or an
early winter's morning, with its sunrise lowering and accompanied by
ever-changing tints lending their enchantments to the rugged grandeur of
the hills which bound it. This, with the distant view up the Clyde,
obtained from the club-house windows or frontage, is not to be surpassed
in any country in the world.</p>

<p>At the opening of the season of 1877, and the close of the second
decade, the club numbered no fewer than 643 members, with a fleet of
yachts computed at 195, and as the Club Regatta now occupied two days,
the three Clyde clubs&mdash;viz. the Royal Clyde, the Royal Northern, and the
four-year-old Mudhook Yacht Club&mdash;considered it necessary to work
together for the furtherance of sport, and held their first meeting to
arrange a suitable date for celebrating a 'Clyde Week.' A change was
also made this season in the several courses at the regattas, a change
which had been for some time considered desirable, and which turned out
a welcome improvement.</p>

<p>The new courses were as follows: For First-Class Yachts, from Hunter's
Quay to Toward buoy, thence to Skelmorlie buoy, thence to the Powder
Vessel's buoy, and thence to Hunter's Quay, leaving all on the port
hand; twice round, distance 50 miles.</p>

<p>The Second-Class Course lay from Hunter's Quay to Skelmorlie buoy,
thence to the Powder Vessel's buoy, and thence to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>(p. 88)</span> Hunter's Quay,
leaving all on the port hand; twice round, distance 40 miles.</p>

<p>The Third-Class Course was from Hunter's Quay to a flagboat moored in
Inverkip Bay, thence to the Powder Vessel's buoy and back to Hunter's
Quay; twice round, distance 30 miles.</p>

<p>The Fourth-Class Course was from Hunter's Quay to the Inverkip flagboat,
and back to Hunter's Quay; twice round, distance 24 miles.</p>

<p>The Fifth-Class Course lay from Hunter's Quay to a flagboat moored off
Dunoon Pier, thence to a flagboat moored off Kilcreggan and back to
Hunter's Quay; twice round, distance 11 miles.</p>

<p>Another new feature this season was the introduction of the Yacht Racing
Association's scale of time allowances, based originally on that drawn
up for the Royal Alfred Yacht Club by their late secretary, Mr. James A.
Lyle. This scale had been in general use by the R.A.Y.C. for many years.</p>

<p>In 1878, not only the club, but all those who had partaken of its
hospitality, had to lament their loss in the death of Mr. Samuel King,
one of the most kind and genial of its members. This year was remarkable
for the entry in the race for first-class yachts on the second day of
the regatta. Five yachts crossed the line for the 60<i>l</i>. prize, not one
of which was less than 100 tons measurement, viz., the 'Lufra,' 222
tons, yawl; 'Jullanar,' yawl, 130 tons; 'Condor,' 190 tons; 'Cythera,'
cutter, 116 tons; and 'Formosa,' cutter, 103 tons. From that day to this
there has never been such a meeting of so many first-class large racing
yachts, showing so great a tonnage. It may be said also of the useful
little 5-ton class, at this time at its zenith of popularity, that the
entries this season were the largest that have ever been known. No fewer
than eight of these mosquitoes, including Mr. York's pretty little 6-ton
yawl 'Rocket,' came to the fore on all the great occasions provided for
their sport.</p>

<i>42 tons</i> (<i>W. Chrystal, Esq., Vice-Com. Royal Clyde</i>). <i>Built by Steele
&amp; Co.</i>, 1881.</p>
</div>

<p>During the years 1879, 1880, and 1881, there was a satisfactory
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page89" name="page89"></a>(p. 89)</span> increase in the number of members, and a consequent
augmentation of the club funds. The annual amount given away at this
period in prizes had reached something over 450<i>l.</i> The entries at the
regattas during the seasons of 1880 and 1881 were splendid in the 20-ton
class; no fewer than seven 20-tonners and the 15-tonner 'Maggie' crossed
the line in 1880, and in 1881 the same number, less the 'Maggie,' did
likewise. A new class of 2&frac12;-tonners was started in 1880 with seven
yachts to its name, and in 1881 still another class had to be catered
for, consisting of 3&frac12;-tonners. The entries, too, this year, in the
first class must not be forgotten; for in these days of fashionable
small yacht racing it almost reads like a fairy tale when it is said
that, out of nine entries, seven yachts were of 89 tons and over, the
other two being about 60 tons each.</p>

<p>If the above two years are notable in the annals of the club, in the
following year, 1882, its prosperity was evinced in a marked degree by
the addition to its possessions of a club yacht; and as there are only
one or two clubs which provide such a luxury for their members, it may
not be amiss to give a short account of the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> employed in
connection with it. Among the 600 to 700 members of the club there were
many who did not care to keep yachts of their own, but enjoyed an
occasional cruise. It was in answer to a proposition made by one of
these gentlemen that funds were procured by means of shares, which were
bought by individual members, and by the club itself. In this way the
necessary amount of purchase money was speedily collected, and a
committee was told off to superintend the choice, purchase, and fitting
out of a yacht, with all arrangements connected with manning, and the
carrying out of the regulations in regard to hire, &amp;c. The yacht thus
secured by the club was the 'Alcyone,' 35-ton cutter, which had been
built by Mr. D. Hatcher, and had proved herself no mean performer in the
40-ton class. She is a good wholesome vessel, and a fast and able
sea-boat. Her accommodation is excellent, and includes berths for five
passengers <span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>(p. 90)</span> at least. There is capital headroom between decks,
and any amount of space for stowage of baggage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The 'Alcyone' is manned by a captain and four hands, and when a member
hires the yacht he has no expenses whatever to provide for beyond the
hire and the keep of himself and friends while on board. Four rules were
framed by the committee in charge, as being necessary for the working of
the scheme, viz:</p>

<p class="quote">
     First.&mdash;The limit of time for hire is 14 days. Second.&mdash;The
     cost of hire is 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per diem, including cruet
     stores. Third.&mdash;The club is to keep a supply of liquors on
     board, to be supplied at a small profit. Fourth.&mdash;Hirers are
     bound, if called upon, to deliver up the yacht in the Holy
     Loch, or at any other anchorage inside the Cumbrae Head.</p>

<p>If it is desired to keep the yacht for a month, then it must be done by
two members joining together in the hire, the one putting his name down
for the first fortnight, and the other for the second. The cost of hire
may seem at first sight somewhat heavy, but the 'Alcyone' is kept up
like a private yacht, and no money has been spared to provide every
possible contrivance which might be conducive to comfort. The success of
the venture is proved by the fact that she has rarely been disengaged or
unlet for more than a day or two during any one season since her
purchase.</p>

<p>Another sign of prosperity was the institution of an annual club ball,
which is held at the St. Andrews Hall, Glasgow, during the winter
months, and acknowledged to be one of the principal balls of the year
and one of the great events of the winter season.</p>

<p>The next year&mdash;1883&mdash;showed a still further advancement in the club's
popularity, for it was the chosen recipient of a Queen's Cup. This prize
was sailed for on July 14, during the 'Clyde Week,' in a race for all
yachts over 40 tons, and no fewer than eleven yachts started.</p>

<i>Winning the Queen's Cup in the Clyde.</i></p>
</div>

<p>If, however, 1883 has been rendered famous for being a Queen's Cup year,
1884 will be noted for the success of its closing cruise, and the sport
it provided. This season surpassed itself in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>(p. 91)</span> the number of
entries for the closing cruise handicap, and never have so many yachts
come forward to race for the handsome cups, the gifts of members of the
club, as on this occasion. In the first match for yachts over 40 tons,
ten entered, including five over 90 tons, three 60-tonners, and two of
40 tons. It was the race for 20-tonners, however, that gave real
character to the meeting, and there can be no mistake in saying that no
other club in the kingdom has ever had to start so many as nine 20- and
two 15-tonners in one race, all clever fast yachts, and no third or
fourth rate cruisers, as will be seen from their names: 'Clara,'
'Lenore,' 'Amathea,' 'Louise,' 'Sayonara,' 'Irene,' 'Thyra,' 'Maggie,'
'Calypso,' 'Rival,' and 'Gem.' In the race for 10-tonners seven started,
among them the old 'Helen' schooner, 17 tons, a yacht which saw more
hard sailing than perhaps any other belonging to the club. She was built
at Cowes, and was one of Halliday's pretty creations, a few of which are
still to be met with. In 1892 she was unfortunately driven on the rocks
off Hafton in the Holy Loch, during a severe gale, and was soon smashed
into matchwood. For the prize in the 5-ton class three put in an
appearance, all the fastest racing yachts of the year.</p>

<p>'Clara,' 10 tons, midship section.</p>
</div>

<p>The courses for yachts of 40 tons and upwards were altered in 1885;
instead of rounding the Powder buoy a mark buoy anchored off Kilcreggan
became the furthest point. In 1886 the club forwarded a challenge to the
New York Yacht Club, in the name of Mr. Jas. Bell, and this ended in the
yacht 'Thistle,' now known as the 'Meteor' and owned by H.I.M. the
German Emperor, being built, and sent across the Atlantic, to contend
for the Cup won by the 'America.' The 'Thistle' and 'Volunteer' matches
were the consequence, and they are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>(p. 92)</span> so well known that it would
be superfluous here to furnish an account of them; suffice it to say
that, though the Scotch yacht did not win the great event, her
performances with the 'Volunteer' not only taught British yachtsmen many
a lesson, but afforded not a few hints to their American rivals.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1887, the end of the club's third decade, the
finances of the club consisted of a capital of 6,990<i>l.</i>, and the amount
at this time annually expended on yacht racing was 487<i>l.</i>, exclusive of
gifts of money made by individual members. During the ten years the
numbers on the list of members fluctuated from 610 to 640: in this
particular year only 610 names appeared on the list. With regard to the
number of yachts sailing under the club flag, there had been the same
variation, for though always between 180 and 197, this year the yachts
numbered only 189, or 11 fewer than the previous year, the gross tonnage
amounting to 12,302 tons.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1886 many matters were discussed which brought
forth fruit in the season of 1887, and made that year more important
than it otherwise would have been. First of all, the club had to regret
the loss of their Commodore, Lord Glasgow, who, after acting for over a
quarter of a century in that office, was compelled to give up the
appointment owing to failing health. Mr. John Clark was elected to take
his place, and Messrs. Jas. Bell and H. Lamont became Vice- and
Rear-Commodores. Mr. York, to whom the writer is much indebted for
assistance given him in compiling this notice, held the office of
secretary and treasurer, which he had so ably filled for over twenty
years. During the winter the club had acquired three boats, of 19 ft.
length on the load water-line, for the benefit of those members who
wished to go out for a day's sail; the three boats being made, as far as
the designer, builder, and sailmaker were concerned, as nearly equal in
merits as it was possible for them to be, in order that they might show
good sport when taken out racing together. Prizes for a race for these
boats have since been regularly given at the regattas, to encourage
members to take them out match sailing. In this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>(p. 93)</span> way they have
proved very useful in initiating many a tiro into the secrets and
mysteries of yacht racing.</p>

<a id="img055" name="img055"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">'LENORE'</span><br>
<i>Fife of Fairlie</i>, 1882.</p>
</div>

<p>This year, too, witnessed another change in yacht measurement. The Yacht
Racing Association had formulated and passed a rule of measurement by
length and sail area, the length to be taken along the load water-line.
This rule was adopted by the club, and at the regattas all yachts were
rated according to it, with the exception of the 3&frac12;-tonners; these,
as they happened to be the class of the year, were allowed to race under
the old rule for which they were built. As many as six of these little
vessels made the Clyde their headquarters and sailed at the regattas.</p>

<p>Through the club's agency, it must not be forgotten, telegraphic
communication was opened up between Hunter's Quay, Glasgow, and the
outer world. The club provided an office and guaranteed the sum required
by the Post Office authorities, and by so doing conferred a benefit not
only on themselves but on the whole surrounding neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Early in 1888 the club was engaged in determining the several classes
under which yachts built to the 'rating rule,' as it was called, should
sail. For this purpose, Messrs. R. Wylie and J. B. Hilliard, the two
well-known representative Clyde yachtsmen, were chosen delegates to
consult with the other leading yacht clubs in the North regarding the
adjustment of a classification for the smaller yachts and sailing boats
racing on the Clyde, and full powers were given them to carry out any
decision that might be arrived at. Those adopted were the 10, 6 and 3
rating classes with two length classes, one of 17 ft. on the water-line
and 19 ft. over all, with a sail area limited to 530 ft.; the mainsail
or lugsail not to exceed .75 of the total sail area; the other class to
be for boats 15 ft. on the water-line. The 6-rating class was chosen
that it might form one in which the 3-tonners of the preceding year
would be able to enter, as they ranged over 5 and under 6 as raters. At
the time these changes were taking place a rule was introduced that
there were to be no 'restrictions on the use of centreboards.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>(p. 94)</span> The great feature of this year's regatta was the 'Queen's Cup,'
the second presented to the club within five years, an event of which
the members may justly be proud. In the interim between the Corinthian
and annual regattas a channel match round Arran was inaugurated, for
yachts not exceeding 9 tons Thames measurement and belonging to any
recognised yacht club, for 50<i>l.</i>, given in two prizes of 35<i>l.</i> and
15<i>l.</i>, and presented by two members of the club. The course lay from
Hunter's Quay down the Firth, through the Kyles of Bute, down Kilbrennan
Sound between Arran and Cantyre, rounding Pladda Island, and home by any
route. The yachts were to be <i lang="la">bona fide</i> cruisers, and only jib-topsails
were prohibited. No restrictions were made as to crew or helmsman. No
fewer than eight small yachts sailed in the race, and it proved a far
greater success than was at first expected.</p>

<p>If this is to be known as the second Queen's Cup year, it will also have
to be remembered for the terrible fire and loss of the club-house and
hotel on July 12, nothing of which was saved, with the exception of some
furniture, one or two models, and a few odds and ends. A club could be
called upon to face no greater calamity, especially at a time when the
season is at its height. Craigend Villa, within a short distance of the
old house, was promptly rented as a makeshift for a year, and fitted up
to meet all immediate necessities, while steps were taken at once to
make arrangements for the building of a new house on the old site. To
forward this the sum of 10,000<i>l.</i> was voted, which with another
8,000<i>l.</i> did not cover all the expenses. At the present moment there
does not exist a more beautiful or conveniently arranged yacht
club-house in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the liberal sums devoted by the club to match sailing,
there have always been at each regatta meeting a plentiful supply of
cups and purses forthcoming to swell the list of prizes, the gifts of
individual members. To enumerate all the donors would be out of place
here, but it is impossible to overlook such names as Bell, Buchanon,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>(p. 95)</span> Clark, Coates, Falconer, Ferguson, Forrester, Lockett, Ure,
Wylie, and York, names which will ever be linked with the club's
successful past.</p>

<p>The year 1890 was remarkable principally for the number of 10-raters
belonging to members, and entered for races in that class. It seemed
like a resuscitation of the old 10-tonner days. On the other hand, the
Clyde, the home of the 5-tonner, had not a single 5-rater to its name,
and a 6-rating class had to be formed to take in the Irish contingent,
which with Mr. Inglis's little 'Darthula' raced for the prizes provided
for them. The 2&frac12;-rater class made its entry in the club programmes,
and started with a small fleet of seven yachts, including four belonging
to the Royal Ulster Yacht Club; but in 1891 this class became the
fashionable class of the year, and the club of itself could boast of no
fewer than eight of these small fry.</p>

<p>The fleet belonging to the club in the year 1857 numbered 56 yachts,
mostly of very small tonnage. By 1867 the number had risen to 87 only,
but then the gross tonnage was very much greater, viz. 1,200 tons. In
1877 there were 194 yachts, including a few screw steamers. In the year
1887, 189 names appeared on the club yacht list, i.e. five fewer than in
1877, but the total tonnage on the other hand amounted to 12,302 tons.
The last half-decade, however, has quite eclipsed all preceding years,
for the yachts now flying the Royal Clyde Yacht Club burgee number 267,
which represent a gross tonnage of no less than 14,407 tons. Last year
not far short of 1,000<i>l.</i> was given in prizes.</p>

<p>The club at the present time numbers 951 members, which will be seen to
be an increase of over 300 within the last five years. It is a pleasure
seldom accorded to writers of club histories to have to record such an
exceptional advance, and in bidding farewell to the society, it may be
firmly hoped and prophesied that long ere the close of its fourth decade
the R.C.Y.C. will have increased its list of members to over four
figures and its yachts and yacht-tonnage in proportion.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>(p. 96)</span> THE ROYAL FORTH YACHT CLUB<br>
<span class="smcap">By R. T. Pritchett</span></h3>

<p>The Forth Club was established in 1848 under the name of the 'Granton
Yacht Club,' and received permission from the Queen to assume the title
of 'Royal Forth' in 1883. The flag of the club is the blue ensign of Her
Majesty's fleet, with a gold crown and Maltese cross. The club is now
well supported, having as patron the Duke of Buccleuch, K.T. Sir Donald
Currie, K.C.M.G., is Commodore, backed by a very influential staff. The
Hon. Secretary is Mr. Bruce Fenwick. The number of members amounts to
nearly 2,000, with a total tonnage of about 4,600; but the Firth of
Forth has serious disadvantages as a yachting centre, being favoured
neither by nature nor circumstances as is the Firth of Clyde, which
absorbs all yachting interests. Mr. T. B. C. West, who carried off the
Queen's Cup at the Regatta in 1892 with his well-known 40-rater 'Queen
Mab,' presented a challenge cup of 100 guineas, to be sailed for
annually in the month of June. That, however, was not sufficient
inducement to get a large entry. The fact is there are so many regattas
now that the tendency is to concentration, and consequently outlying
stations suffer.</p>

<p>The Royal Forth Yacht Club had a match in June 1893, at the beginning of
their water sports, from Hartlepool to Granton, for a prize of 30<i>l.</i>

<p>The wind was very light at the start, which took place at 10.50 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on
Thursday, June 22. Later on light airs from east-north-east helped them;
but off the Farne Islands&mdash;without any notice or disturbed appearance in
the sky&mdash;a tremendous squall struck 'Creole'; she, however, behaved
splendidly, and was specially well handled. By Saturday morning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98"></a>(p. 98)</span> the weather had moderated and they got the mainsail on her and
ran up past Inch Keith, getting the gun at 11.34 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> from the

<p>The larger vessel, the yawl of 89-rating, had her troubles too, and
finally got into the Tyne on Saturday morning, under storm canvas.</p>

<p>On the last day of the racing&mdash;June 26&mdash;there was a match for yachts
belonging to the Royal Forth Yacht Club, for the T. B. C. West Challenge
Cup, the entries confined to members of the club. Five yachts entered
for the race, over a course of forty miles. The tonnage was very small,
and the handicap one of large range; it will be noted that 'Ida,' at
scratch, allowed 'Lintie' 1 hr. 23 mins. 48 secs.</p>

<span class="smaller">IRISH CLUBS</span></h2>

<h3>THE ROYAL CORK YACHT CLUB<br>
<span class="smcap">By R. T. Pritchett</span></h3>

<p>The ancestral origin of this club, which has its station at Queenstown,
was the Water Club of the Harbour of Cork, established in 1720. It is
therefore the <i lang="fr">doyen par excellence</i>, and its rules and orders as
carried out in its early days are original and entertaining. A few of
the rules may be quoted:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>I. Ordered that the Water Club be held once every spring
     tide, from the first spring tide in April to the last in
     September inclusive.</p>

     <p>II. That no Admiral do bring more than two dishes of meat
     for the entertainment of the club.</p>

     <p>III. Resolved that no Admiral presume to bring more than two
     dozen of wine to his treat, for it has always been deemed a
     breach of the ancient rules and constitutions of the club,
     except when my Lords the Judges are invited.</p>

     <p>V. Ordered that the Secretary do prepare an Union flag, with
     the Royal Irish harp and crown on a green field in the
     centre.</p>

     <p>Ordered that the Water Club flag be hoisted on club days
     early in the morning on the Castle of Haulbowline.</p>

     <p>IX. Ordered that no long tail wigs, large sleeves or ruffles
     be worn by any member at the club.</p>

     <p>Ordered that when any of the fleet join the Admiral, if they
     have not guns to salute they are to give three cheers, which
     are to be returned by the Admiral, and one cheer to be
     returned by the Captain so saluting.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> XIII. Resolved that twenty-five be the whole number
     of the members that this club may consist of.</p>

     <p>XIV. Resolved that such members of the club or others as
     shall talk of sailing after dinner be fined a bumper.</p>

     <p>XX. Ordered that the Knight of the Island for the time being
     do suffer no person or persons whatsoever to go into the
     club room, unless brought by a member, or by an order of
     five members at the least, under their hands, on pain of
     being cashiered.</p>

     <p>XXI. That the Admiral singly, or any three captains whom he
     shall appoint, do decide all controversies and disputes that
     may arise in the club, and any Captain that shall refuse to
     abide by such decision is to be expelled. N.B. This order to
     extend to the Chaplain, or any other inferior officer.</p>

     <p><em>April 21, 1737.</em>&mdash;Ordered that for the future, unless the
     company exceed the number of fifteen, no man be allowed more
     than one bottle to his share, and a peremptory. [What a
     'peremptory' was remains a mystery.]</p>

     the Admiral is abreast of the Castle in Spike Island, to
     forfeit a British half-crown for gunpowder for the fleet.</p>

     <p>When the Admiral hoists his foresail half up, it is for the
     fleet to have a peak upon their anchor, and when the
     foresail is hoisted up and a gun fired, the whole fleet is
     to weigh.</p>

     <p><em>Observe</em> that if the Admiral wants to speak with any of the
     fleet he will make the following signals.</p>

     <p>If with the Vice-Admiral he will hoist a white flag at the
     end of the gaff or derrick, and fire two guns.</p>

     <p>If with any private Captain he will hoist a pendant at his
     derrick, and fire as many guns as the Captain is distanced
     from him and from the same side.</p>

     <p>When he would have the fleet come to an anchor, he will show
     double Dutch colours at the end of his gaff and fire a gun.</p>

     <p>When the Admiral will have the whole fleet to chase he will
     hoist Dutch colours under his flag, and fire a gun from each
     quarter; if a single boat he will hoist a pendant and fire
     as many guns from the side as a boat is distanced from him.
     When he would have the chase given over, he will haul in his
     flag and fire a gun.</p>
</div>

<p>Some storm seems suddenly to have burst upon the gay fleet, for after
the year 1765 there is a long vacuum in the records. The club journal
sets forth, however, that on July 1, 1806, the Marquis of Thomond, Lord
Kingsale, the Fitzgeralds, the Penroses, the Newenhams, the Drurys, and
others, styled therein 'original members,' met, and agreed to revive the
old Water Club; but there is no reason to suppose that the club was set
afloat in its ancient splendour, and the attention of the members would
appear to have been chiefly directed to the useful purpose of exciting
competition among the fishing and rowing boats in the harbour, to which
they gave annual prizes.</p>

<p class="smcap">ROYAL CORK YACHT CLUB QUEENSTOWN.</p>
</div>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1821, the yachting spirit of both sexes in
Cork Harbour declined, and the Water Club was but feebly kept up;
indeed, Lords Thomond and Kingsale, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> Messrs. Savage, French,
Cooper Penrose, Thomas Roland, John Marragh, William Harrington, John
Roche, with a few others, were its sole representatives; and the club as
a body at this period may be almost said to have become extinct, as no
meetings were held, or proceedings recorded.</p>

<p>But the next year a party of youngsters, higher up the river, took
possession of the vacant territory, and in 1822 a little fleet was again
seen in the harbour. This society, originating in a picnic club, having
its rendezvous at Monkstown, and consisting of small craft, did not
assume the title of the Cork Harbour Club, but contented itself with the
more humble appellation of the 'Little Monkstown Club.' From these small
beginnings, however, the present Royal Cork Yacht Club had its immediate
origin, in 1828, when Thomas Hewitt, Caulfield Beamish, and a few other
enterprising individuals of the Monkstown Club, supported by the
patriotic proprietor of 'Footy,' John Smith-Barry, and the greater part
of the old Water Club members then living, met and resolved to revive
and re-establish it on a solid and permanent basis.</p>

<p>The new arrangements were judiciously made, and the club, re-established
under the title of the Cork Yacht Club, rose rapidly to eminence.</p>

<p>The Water Club is ably and favourably noticed in the 'Tour through
Ireland.' (London. Printed for J. Roberts, in Warwick Lane, 1748.)</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>I shall now acquaint your Lordships with a ceremony they
     have at Cork. It is somewhat like that of the Doge of Venice
     wedding the sea. A set of worthy gentlemen who have formed
     themselves into a body, which they call the 'Water Club,'
     proceed a few leagues out to sea once a year, in a number of
     little vessels, which for painting and gilding exceed the
     King's yacht at Greenwich and Deptford. Their Admiral, who
     is elected annually, and hoists his flag on board his little
     vessel, leads the van and receives the honours of the flag.
     The rest of the fleet fall in their proper stations and keep
     their line in the same manner as the King's ships. This
     fleet is attended with a prodigious number of boats, which,
     with their colours flying, drums beating, and trumpets
     sounding, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> forms one of the most agreeable and
     splendid sights your Lordships can conceive.</p>

     <p>The Union with harp and crown in the centre on a green
     field, was granted by the Lords of the Admiralty to William,
     Earl of Inchiquin, for the Cork Harbour Yacht Club, in 1759.</p>

<p>The present club-house is delightfully situated at Queenstown; though
old association clings rather to Haulbowline, with its quaint history.
The old pictures in the club-rooms of the Water Club yachts are valuable
as showing what the craft were in those days. Age has sombred them down
so much that many details are unfortunately lost. We are indebted to
Major H. H. Newman, the Hon. Secretary, for his assistance, and also to
Major Lysaght, who kindly photographed these paintings.</p>

<h3>THE CLUBS AT KINGSTOWN, DUBLIN Co.</h3>

<p>Kingstown Harbour, so admirably adapted for sailing, has long been a
favourite spot with yachtsmen. Formerly Kingstown was a small creek
called Dunleary, but King George IV. embarked there on September 3,
1821, and promised a grant for a new harbour, which was finished in 1859
at a cost of 825,000<i>l.</i> This harbour encloses a clear sheet of water
250 acres in extent, of depth from 15 ft. to 27 ft. at low water, with a
rise of 8 ft. or 9 ft. It affords good holding ground and shelter from
all winds, and, being a harbour of refuge, there are no harbour fees. As
a yachting station, in addition to being a safe anchorage, it has the
advantage of enabling a yacht to get in or out to the open sea in a few
minutes at any tide. The East Pier is a mile long, and forms one of the
most perfect marine promenades in the world. Yachting took root here
when the St. George's Yacht Club was established in 1838, though perhaps
it should more strictly be dated from 1845 as it was in the latter year
it obtained its Admiralty warrant. It has now become Royal, with Her
Majesty the Queen as Patroness; Lord Dunleath (formerly John
Mulholland, Esq.,) <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> Vice-Commodore. A remarkably fine class
of yachts is brought together in this club, and when the regatta is held
Kingstown Harbour presents one of the finest aquatic spectacles in the
world, embracing yachts and sailing boats of all classes. The 'Mermaids'
and the 'Water Wags,' which give annually great sport in the Bay, are
described in a following chapter. The Royal Irish Club has its
club-house in a fine and convenient situation; established as it was in
1846, there will soon be two yachting jubilee regattas in Dublin Bay.
July is the month when aquatic revelry is in full swing. Many is the
hard race sailed from the harbour round The Kish, and many the spar
carried away when the high-spirited Corinthians have been cracking on.
The Royal Ulster meets at Bangor, Co. Down, having the Marquis of
Dufferin as Commodore; Lord Dunleath as Vice-Commodore; Captain
Sharman-Crawford, of 'Red Lancer' fame, as Rear-Commodore.</p>

<h3>ROYAL ALFRED YACHT CLUB<br>
<span class="smcap">By G. L. Blake</span></h3>

<p>No sporting society in the whole of the three kingdoms has done more to
encourage seamanship than that which has its station in Dublin Bay, and
has been known for so many years past as the Royal Alfred Yacht Club.
Worked on a basis somewhat different from that of most clubs, whose
object is the encouragement of amateur sailing, this community sprang
into being on March 19, 1857, at a meeting held in Gilbert's Hotel,
Westland Row, Dublin, under the chairmanship of that fine practical
yachtsman the late Mr. William Cooper, so well known to all patrons of
the sport by his valuable works on the pastime he loved so well, written
under the pseudonym 'Vanderdecken.'</p>

<p><i>Royal Irish Yacht Club Cup, Kingstown, July 24, 1873</i><br>
(<i>from a picture by Admiral Beechy</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>'Smartness' might have been the motto of the newly launched club, for
within a few weeks of the above date the Irish Model Yacht Club&mdash;thus
it was christened while yet on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>(p. 109)</span> the ways&mdash;had taken on board
all the essentials necessary for a lengthened and prosperous voyage.
Acker's signals were its code, and words of wisdom in the form of club
rules had been duly got out and printed. A captain of the fleet,
secretary, and treasurer, backed up by a very able committee of
thirteen, constituted the 'powers that be'; and under their auspices, on
May 21, the yachts of the club made their début in company in Ireland's
Bay of Naples.</p>

<p>It was during the following year that one of those rules was framed
which proved for so many years such a notable club feature. It ran as
follows: 'Every Saturday shall be a Fleet day unless there be notice to
the contrary, and all yachts on the station, under a fine of 5<i>s.</i>,
shall be bound to join the fleet at a given hour, unless a satisfactory
reason for the yacht's absence be given to the Sailing Committee. No
yacht is to join unless the owner, or a member of a Yacht Club, be on
board.' Of course this regulation has had to be rescinded in order to
allow of club matches taking place, and the cruises in company have
become less frequent; but it is impossible to estimate the value to
seamanship of fleet sailing, because there is no method by which the
sailor can more readily attain to the complete command of his vessel,
and make her answer to his bidding. Sailing as he will be on such
occasions in company with yachts of various sizes, sail-carrying power
and speed, the yachtsman who can keep station will have learnt not only
to have a confidence in himself and his vessel, but also how to vary her
degrees of sailing from the reeling off of knots to an up and down log
line.</p>

<p>In 1859 the club was practically reorganised. A new book of amended
rules and regulations was printed, and a book of signals produced and
compiled by Mr. Jas. A. Lyle, who had been appointed honorary secretary.
Among these new rules was this very useful and simple one: 'Each owner
is to lodge with the secretary a duplicate of his racing flag, and this
flag is to be carried on board the Commodore's yacht of the day, to
facilitate signalling and avoidance of mistakes.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span> Towards the end of the season Lord Otho Fitzgerald, who had up
to this time acted as captain of the fleet, gave up the office, and till
it was eventually done away with, a Challenge Cup was instituted, open
to all yachts of 15 tons (the largest size among the racing fleet) and
under, to be sailed for annually. It was ruled that in future the holder
of this cup should fill the office of captain of the fleet for the
ensuing year.</p>

<p>So far the club matches had been few and somewhat irregular. Three
classes had been formed, consisting of yachts of 10 and not exceeding 15
tons, of 6 and not over 10, and of others under 6 tons. This year,
however, was started the annual series of racing matches, which have for
over thirty years been so popular with the racing fraternity of St.
George's Channel and the Clyde; and each season's programme has only
undergone such alterations as have been necessitated by the increased
tonnage of the competing yachts, or as may further racing according to
the fashionable sizes of the yachts of the period. About this date, too,
it was found necessary to obviate the difficulty which was being felt
with regard to manning and sailing yachts, owing to the number of large
yachts, which already flew the club burgee; the original rule, that
permitted members only to be employed, was therefore stretched, in order
to admit of any member of a Royal Yacht Club, who had paid his
subscription, or any gentleman amateur not a seafaring man, being
entered as a racing hand.</p>

<p>In 1864 the club advanced another step safely, and emerging from its
chrysalis stage of a model yacht club, butterflied it in public as the
Prince Alfred Yacht Club, keeping the same objects in view as hitherto,
viz., the encouragement of match sailing and the acquisition of
practical knowledge amongst its members of how to steer and handle their
own vessels, especially while sailing. Commodores were appointed in
place of a captain of the fleet, to carry on the more extended duties of
the club; and Messrs. Putland, Scovell, and Bolton, whose names are
household words throughout the yachting world, were the first officers
to hold the appointments. No fewer <span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>(p. 111)</span> than five classes had now to
be created to take in the racing fleet; the class for yachts of 40 tons
and over included all the big ones, that for 7 tons and under was open
to the small fry.</p>

<p>Two years later (1866) the Duke of Edinburgh identified himself more
closely than heretofore with the club that bore his name, by becoming
its patron, and presenting a cup to be sailed for; and it was during
this season that prizes were instituted, in the shape of gold pins
bearing the club burgee, to especially encourage the art of
helmsmanship. 1866 is also worthy of being remembered as having
witnessed the introduction of the annual Kingstown and Holyhead matches,
with which, since that time, the racing programme of the season has
nearly always started.</p>

<p>The standing rule which specially distinguishes this club is that all
money received shall go towards racing expenses and prize funds. The
consequence follows that, limited though the club is to 300 members
(there were 200 in 1864), it is able to provide good prizes for all
classes, and can show more sport for its money than many another richer
club which is hampered with a house. The proof of the pudding is in the
eating, and the success of this homeless club, as many have called it,
should read a really useful lesson to the committees of all young
yachting or other sporting communities, not to be too anxious about
bricks and mortar or entering on the responsibilities of housekeeping.</p>

<p>In 1868 another new feature, which at once became popular and is so to
the present day, was started by Mr. G. B. Thompson. This was a series of
matches to be held each year for yachts manned by amateurs only; and it
is in some of these races, which have taken place during the past
quarter of a century, that the capabilities of the members have
prominently appeared as first-class able seamen. This season, however,
will always be remembered for the race that was sailed on June 1 by the
2nd class yachts&mdash;viz. those over 25 and under 40 tons, in which the 3rd
class yachts were allowed to enter at 26 tons. The 'Xema,' 35;
'Vampire,' 20 (rated at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span> 26); 'Echo,' yawl, 37; 'Secret,' 31;
'Kilmeny,' 30; 'Wavecrest,' yawl, 35; and 'Amberwitch,' yawl, 52 tons,
started. Three paid hands were allowed to each yacht. The course lay
from Kingstown Harbour, round the North Bar buoy, Kish Lightship, and
the Hauling buoy in Kingstown Harbour&mdash;twice round, to start from
moorings. Though the weather was anything but satisfactory, all the
morning had been fine, and there had been scarcely any wind, so that
light muslin, in the shape of large topsails, balloon foresails, and big
No. 1 jibs, was donned by all the competitors, at all events for the
reach out to the Bar buoy. The old 'Bat' was the first to get away, but
she was soon overhauled by the 'Echo,' the rest following in line
abreast. As the day grew on, the wind, from being shifty and all over
the place, gradually settled down from the eastward, and the 'Wavecrest'
being the first to feel the true wind, she very naturally made use of
it, and went through her vessels as if they had been at anchor. She was
not allowed, however, to have the game all to herself for many moments,
as the 'Amberwitch' and 'Xema' were soon on her track, while the
'Kilmeny' and 'Vampire' indulged in a luffing match, and almost allowed
the 'Secret' and 'Echo,' which were doing rearguard, to overtake them.</p>

<p>The buoy was rounded in the order given above, and as the wind had been
increasing rapidly the crews were now called on to show their smartness
in handing in the wind persuaders and substituting second jibs and
working foresails for the close-haul out to the Kish. Those who know
what the face of the waters is like off the Kish Bank when a hard
easterly wind has set in will have some idea of the kind of business
that was being transacted on this occasion, on the outward journey. Soon
it became evident that topsails were altogether out of place, and those
who had shifted ballooners for small square-headers had to take them in
again and house their topmasts. The 'Xema' alone held on, though it
could easily be seen that her topsail was not helping her at all. She
had quite trouble enough too, as it turned out, without having useless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span> top-hamper aloft, for her weather bowsprit shrouds began to
show such signs of distress that it became necessary for her to hand in
her head-sail and set a small jib. The 'Amberwitch' was heeling and
toeing it to such an extent that, by sagging away to leeward, it became
quite clear she was by no means having things her own way. The 'Xema,'
on the other hand, notwithstanding her sail-plan, coming up under the
'Kilmeny's' lee, was forereaching well on her, when a further trouble
overtook her in the parting of the main outhaul, and the traveller
coming in as far as the reef battens&mdash;there were no outhaul horses in
1868&mdash;left the mainsail in a bag, a misfortune which was at once taken
advantage of by the 'Kilmeny,' who promptly gave her the go-by.</p>

<p>The 'Vampire' had quite as much as she liked with the broken sea she had
to drive through, but it would have rejoiced the heart of the late Mr.
Dan Hatcher, her builder, had he seen the way in which his little vessel
stepped it out to windward and held her own with her larger sisters. The
Kish was passed by the 'Kilmeny' as leader of the van, and she was
followed by the 'Xema,' 'Amberwitch,' 'Echo,' and little 'Bat' in the
order named. Now that they had rounded the lightship topmasts were sent
on end again by all, with the exception of the 'Echo,' whose crosstrees
had come to grief; square-headers were once more seen aloft, and sheets
were checked well off for the run to the harbour. On nearing the piers
the wind lightened as quickly as it had got up; it left the leading
yachts almost becalmed, and only just able to gybe round the mark.</p>

<p>Starting away again for the second round, the 'Xema' made use of the
lack of wind to set up her headgear and secure her bowsprit shroud, but
she had barely set things to rights before the wind came on with double
vigour. It was a reach this time out to the Kish, and weight naturally
telling, 'Kilmeny' was outpaced by the 'Xema,' which led round the
lightship, followed closely by the 'Amberwitch,' 'Kilmeny,' 'Echo,' and
'Vampire,' with 'Wavecrest' to bring up the rear. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> 'Secret'
had got into difficulties about a mile from the lightship by her
bowsprit snapping off close at the gammon iron, and with the sea that
was running its crew had their work cut out for them in clearing the
wreckage and sending out a jury spar. With the rest of the fleet it was
a case once more of up topmasts and topsails for the run home, and a
most exciting race was being sailed by the 'Xema' and 'Amberwitch' for
the first place (the latter had to allow 'Xema' 2 mins. 12 secs., as she
was a 51-ton yawl), when the wind, drawing off the shore as before on
nearing their destination, brought it to an end. The sheets had
accordingly to be hardened in, and a board to be made into Scotsman's
Bay to get the benefit of the young flood, which was running in shore. A
couple of short tacks now brought the 'Xema' clear out on the weather of
the 'Amberwitch' and 'Kilmeny,' so that, gaining inch by inch, she
managed to win at last. Nothing could have exceeded the smart manner in
which the shifting of sails and the work aloft was carried out on board
all the yachts.</p>

<p>In 1869, the honorary secretary, Mr. Lyle, to whom the Club will ever be
indebted for the care and interest he has shown in furthering its
welfare, gave a tankard as a prize for a one-handed race, the conditions
of which were: 'Only one man, and he a member of the Club, shall be on
board, and all others must leave before any canvas is set or station
taken.' Flying starts had not yet come into fashion, and therefore buoys
had to be picked up. No fewer than ten yachts started for this race,
five of which were over 10, and three over 5 tons. The 'Queen,' 15 tons,
was the winner, but the season will be best known by the introduction of
the celebrated Champion Cups, which have ever since shared the honours
with the Corinthian matches in the Club programmes. To secure the
necessary funds for providing these luxuries, members were permitted to
commute their annual subscriptions by the payment down of 10<i>l.</i> By this
means the greater portion of the handsome pieces of plate, for which so
many flyers of their day have competed, were obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> The Duke of Edinburgh, who, as already remarked, had been
patron, assumed in 1871 the duties of commodore, a post he is still
holding; the club had become Royal in the previous winter. The limit in
the number of members was increased from 200 to 300, and the club burgee
also underwent a change. Up to this date the club had sailed under no
fewer than four different burgees. The original flag consisted of a red
anchor on a blue field, but this only enjoyed a short life, as the
anchor was changed into an Irish crown before the first season was over.
In 1859, the flag appeared with a white ground, a blue cross with four
points at the intersection of the cross forming the design, and in 1861
the field was changed again from white to red, with the new device of a
yellow foul anchor. Now for the last time the device was altered from
the ordinary foul anchor to that of a foul patent Trotman under an
Imperial crown. The patent improved anchor represents the club's leading
position as a Corinthian yacht racing society.</p>

<p>Besides five champion cups of the several values of 120<i>l.</i>, 60<i>l.</i>,
35<i>l.</i>, 25<i>l.</i>, and 15<i>l.</i>, one in fact for each class, the Duke of
Edinburgh presented a 50<i>l.</i> cup. A gale of wind sprang up during the
race for this prize, which was won by Mr. George Putland in the 'Enid.'
She was the only one of all the yachts that crossed the line&mdash;flying
starts were instituted this year&mdash;to finish the course, and it was the
rounding of the Kish Lightship in this race by the 'Enid' that Admiral
Beechy took as the subject of one of his most celebrated sea pictures.
The 'Egeria,' schooner, was disabled very early in the race by the
carrying away of the iron strop round her boom.</p>

<p>During the season of 1872 the club was presented with the first of the
three Queen's Cups of which it has been a recipient. Matches during the
summer alternated each Saturday with cruises in fleet under one of the
club officers, with regard to which one great point should be noticed,
viz., that it has been the custom to sail only one match as a rule on
each of the racing Saturdays. There are many other clubs which would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span> do well to follow this example, as it is not infrequently next
to impossible with some clubs for outport members and yacht-owners, when
wishing to join in Corinthian matches, to obtain competent hands.</p>

<p>1872 was the last year in which single-handed racing received club
support. A single-handed match had been sailed each season since their
inauguration by Mr. Lyle, Mr. Alec Richardson winning twice (in 1870 and
1871) in the 'Naiad,' 10-tonner; but the sad loss of Mr. O'Connell, one
of the most popular and sporting members of the club, together with his
yacht, and the narrow escape from foundering of another, emphasised the
advisability to stop such races for the future. The race in which this
disaster occurred took place on June 1. The day was a peculiar one. A
double-handed match had been sailed during the fore- and early
afternoon, when a nice S.E. breeze favoured the competitors, which had
one and all carried large topsails aloft. This race was finished,
however, in a heavy downpour of rain, and was won by the Vice-Commodore,
Mr. George Thompson, in the 'Madcap,' 20 tons. After the race was over
the rain came down in such torrents that there was some hesitation about
allowing the single-handed match to start, though there was no
appearance of any heavy weather setting in. This fact, and there being
no sea to speak of, settled the question, and accordingly the 'Petrel,'
10 tons, Mr. W. G. Jamieson; 'Mocassin,' 10, Mr. Corrigan; 'Madcap,' 20,
the Vice-Commodore; 'Torment,' 5, Mr. Miller; and 'Peri,' 5 tons, Mr.
O'Connell, most of them with reefed mainsails, made a start at 3 hrs. 5
mins. in the order named. The weather soon afterwards became very thick,
and nothing was seen of the yachts till 6 hrs. 34 mins., when the
'Petrel' was discovered making for home. A number of yachts were out all
the afternoon, and some of them on coming into harbour had passed the
word that things were not going on as sweetly as they might outside. The
wind had shifted to the S.W., and a considerable sea was running,
increased or rather broken by the flood-tide. The 'Mocassin,' who had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> given up, corroborated the statement that was flying about, and
soon after the 'Heroine,' 60-ton cutter, arrived with her topmast gone,
followed by the 'Whirlwind' yawl, with the loss of her gig washed away
from her davits.</p>

<p>The danger was now clearly apparent, and a tug was immediately sent out
to look for the yachts, as it was feared the small ones would be unable
to beat up against the sea and make their port. The 'Pleione,' schooner,
had fortunately fallen in with the 'Madcap,' and put a hand on board her
just in the nick of time, for she had shipped a heavy cargo of water
below owing to her fore hatch having been washed overboard, and her
head-sheets had gone. The 'Torment' ran for Howth, whence she was helped
back to her moorings by a friendly tug, which was sent later on to her
assistance. The 'Pleione,' however, reported that the unfortunate 'Peri'
had been pooped, and that she had immediately foundered, taking with her
her plucky crew. The schooner had sailed on and about the spot for some
time, hoping against hope to recover some memento of the catastrophe to
carry back to Kingstown, and the tug was also employed in cruising round
the locality, but to no purpose, as nothing was seen after she went down
of either the 'Peri' or her owner. Though it is now more than ten years
since this sorrowful occurrence, the name of Mr. D. O'Connell, beloved
by all who knew him as a keen sportsman and a most genial friend, still
remains green in the memory of Irish yachtsmen.</p>

<p>Useful as the single-handed matches were for bringing out a display of
seamanship, confidence and independence, it was as well under the
circumstances that at this time they should end; but it seems a pity
that the two-handed matches should have received their death-blow as
well. The extra hand means all the difference between danger and safety.</p>

<p>Of the work carried out by the club perhaps the programme for 1874 gives
as fair a sample as it is possible to choose, taking one year with
another. The list of matches was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> Nos. 1 and 2. Matches to and from Douglas, Isle of
     Man.</p>

     <p>No. 3. Match for yachts not exceeding 7 tons. No. 5 Champion
     Cup, with 7<i>l.</i> added.</p>

     <p>No. 4. Match for yachts not exceeding 20 tons. Corinthian
     Race. 25<i>l.</i> Helmsman 5<i>l.</i>, with tankards for the crew.</p>

     <p>No. 5. For yachts not exceeding 25 tons. No. 3 Champion Cup;
     with 25<i>l.</i> added.</p>

     <p>No. 6. Open to all yachts. Corinthian Race, 50<i>l.</i> Helmsman
     5<i>l.</i>, and tankards for crew.</p>

     <p>No. 7. For all yachts not exceeding 7 tons; 15<i>l.</i> given by
     Mr. Macartney.</p>

     <p>No. 8. Match open to all yachts. No. 1 Champion Cup, 50<i>l.</i>
     added; two helmsmen's prizes of 4<i>l.</i> each.</p>

     <p>No. 9. For all yachts not exceeding 15 tons; 1st prize
     15<i>l.</i>, 2nd prize 10<i>l.</i>, given by Mr. Fulton. Helmsman
     5<i>l.</i></p>

     <p>No. 10. For all yachts not exceeding 40 tons. 2nd Champion
     Cup, with 35<i>l.</i> added.</p>

     <p>No. 11. For all yachts not exceeding 15 tons. 4th Champion
     Cup, with 15<i>l.</i> added.</p>
</div>

<p>One more race, which was promoted this year, must not be forgotten, as
it would prove a very advantageous item in all yacht-club programmes,
viz. a swimming match in clothes. The conditions were as follows: 'Each
member must wear woollen socks, a pair of slippers, shoes or boots,
woollen or canvas trousers, a flannel shirt, with a guernsey or yachting
jacket; the distance to be covered 200 yards.'</p>

<p>In the Corinthian matches it may be noticed that the club not only gives
the customary helmsman's prize, and that a good one, but each member of
the winning crew receives a tankard with the yacht's complement or the
club burgee engraved on it, a principle again worthy of adoption by all
Corinthian yacht clubs in races where no paid hands are permitted.</p>

<p>At this period the club had the fine total of 163 yachts to a list of
fewer than 300 members; and to show how admirably everything was carried
on to the furtherance of sport, prizes were given to the amount of
364<i>l.</i> out of an income of 521<i>l.</i>, the club expenditure being more
than covered by 78<i>l.</i> These <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span> statistics are of interest as
showing what can be done by a club when not fettered by club premises.</p>

<p>The entry in the season of 1875 for the No. 1 Champion Cup is worthy of
a notice here, since no fewer than seven of the large cracks of the year
put in an appearance&mdash;'Fiona,' 75 tons; 'Cuckoo,' 92; 'Neva,' 62;
'Speranza,' yawl, 85; 'Latona,' yawl, 165; 'Egeria,' schooner, 147; and
'Gwendolin,' schooner, 197 tons; and as an example of a R.A.Y.C.
Corinthian match, that which took place on July 17, 1876, for 'Twenty
Tonners' will long be remembered, not so much for its record of
spar-breaking, as for the seamanlike way in which difficulties were
overcome. The description of the race is here given almost in the words
of an account for which the writer is indebted to Mr. James Drury, who
was himself an active witness on the occasion. The weather was far from
favourable owing to a strong gale during the previous night having
raised a nasty tumbling sea on the banks, while the wind, though
moderate in the early part of the afternoon, at times blew in fierce
squalls, rendering it necessary to reduce canvas at awkward moments.</p>

<p>Prizes: Owner, 25<i>l.</i>; helmsman, 5<i>l.</i>; crew, tankards. Course No. 3 (24
miles), no paid hands allowed. Though the number of competitors was
smaller than usual, the quality was extremely good, all four being well
known as about the best of their class. A nice southerly breeze was
blowing, making it an easy reach to the South Bar buoy, and the tide was
just beginning to flow to the northward. The 'Hinda' was the first away,
steered by her owner, followed close astern by the 'Sunshine,' which had
won so many prizes in 1874, with Mr. Henry Dudgeon at her helm.
'Sheilah' was third, with the late Mr. Pascoe French as pilot, and
last, though only some 45 seconds behind <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> the leader, came the
'Challenge,' with a crew who had come over from Liverpool in her or by
steamer, and comprised the cream of the Mersey and Cheshire yacht clubs,
among them Mr. Richardson, her designer, who now handled the lines. The
'Hinda' and 'Sunshine' each carried a crew of eight hands all told,
while the 'Sheilah' and 'Challenge' had a complement each of ten hands,
including the helmsman.</p>

<p>All the yachts had whole lower canvas and jibheaded topsails set, except
the 'Sheilah,' who had a small square header aloft, and 'Sunshine,' who
had prudently reefed her mainsail and foresail, although they still
looked big enough for a 30 even thus reduced. The 'Sheilah' soon showed
her speed off the wind, as, going through 'Sunshine's' lee like a dart,
she led the fleet and placed herself some 50 seconds ahead of any other
by the time she had made the first turning point, where it was 'gybe
ho,' and she increased this lead to 2&frac14; minutes at the Rosebeg, the
others having played at luffing and thus impeded each other.</p>

<p>Sheets were now hardened in for a close haul to the North and South
Burford buoys, and 'Sheilah' soon found her topsail too much for her in
the jumpy sea; but unfortunately it had been set with the tack to
leeward, and was not therefore handy for shifting, while, worse than
this, her big No. 1 jib was pulling her head off, and with a single
sheet only it was more than her foremast hands could manage to get it
properly aft. The 'Challenge' held a beautiful wind, and getting clear
of the other two, weathered fast on 'Sheilah,' though she did not
headreach on her. Mr. French, wishing to shift his topsail, went about
on the port tack before he could weather the South Burford, but meeting
the 'Challenge' on the starboard tack, and fearing he would not be able
to clear her, stayed under her lee, with the effect of being dead
covered for four or five minutes, when the first bitter puff that came
clear of the after leach of 'Challenge's' mainsail whipped 'Sheilah's'
topmast over her side. She was immediately hove about, and her crew set
to work to clear away the wreck, Messrs. Drury and Dunne <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span>
running aloft and casting off the topsail lacing; but before they could
get the sail down or the rigging secured, it was found necessary to go
about again in order to pass the mark on the proper hand, and four or
five minutes banging about of the wreck to leeward laced everything up
into such a horrible state of confusion that it took the crew all they
knew to get the topsail below, the broken mast on deck, and the rigging
secured.</p>

<p>The 'Challenge' in the meantime, capitally sailed and handled, crept
away steadily, and the 'Hinda' drew up on the 'Sheilah,' while the
'Sunshine' still kept the rear, not seeming to like the rough water. At
2 hrs. 27 mins. 35 secs. the 'Challenge' stayed round the buoy in
Kingstown Harbour, followed by the 'Sheilah' 2 hrs. 33 mins. 10 secs.,
having her tricolour flag flying from her crosstree. The 'Hinda' rounded
at 2 hrs. 34 mins. 55 secs., and the 'Sunshine' at 2 hrs. 37 mins. 30
secs. The wind was now much more westerly, and the squalls stronger. The
'Sheilah' set her balloon foresail for the reach out, in hopes of
lessening the distance between her and the leader, and certainly gained
a little. After the gybe Mr. French determined to shift his jib,
especially as the starboard whisker had begun to buckle, and for this
purpose gybed back and ran in under Howth&mdash;a great loss of time, for
when the boom came over again the 'Hinda' was ahead.</p>

<p>The 'Sunshine,' after reaching Rosebeg, carried away her mast bodily,
some 17 ft. from the deck, and the whole top-hamper fell overboard,
leaving her helpless, and in anything but a pleasant predicament with so
heavy a sea running, and the rocks of Howth under her lee. However,
several yachts and a tug went off to her assistance, and after drifting
round the Bailey, the tug got hold of her and brought her back, a sad
wreck, to Kingstown Harbour. Meanwhile the squalls were becoming
sharper, and the sea heavier and more broken, threatening destruction to
bowsprits and bobstays, as the little vessels wallowed in the trough.
The 'Sheilah,' showing her power, drew up abreast and close to the
'Hinda' between the Burfords, and all hands were admiring the way she
was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> carrying her canvas, having her jib-topsail still aloft,
and going like a bird, when crash! away went her mast, just under the
hounds, leaving her quite as helpless as the 'Sunshine,' but in clearer
and more open water. No one was hurt, and the 'Sheilah' at once triced
up her tack, lowered her foresail, and hove to alongside her disabled
consort in order to give help if required. Her crew employed themselves,
while waiting, in hauling down a reef. This 'Challenge' perceived, and
having matters quite safe, she at once followed suit, and made all snug
for the thrash home of four miles; a happy matter for her, as her mast
was badly sprung and might have gone at any moment. By the time the
reefs were down, the 'Whirlwind,' 77-ton yawl, belonging to Mr. J.
Townsend, had hastened to the assistance of her disabled little sister,
and sending a warp to her, took her in tow. The 'Challenge,' on resuming
her course, was well ahead, and eventually the race ended by her
rounding the flagships at 4 hrs. 37 mins. 10 secs., winning the prize
for her owner, the helmsman's prize for Mr. Alec Richardson, and
tankards for her crew, who deserved them well for their pluck in coming
from Liverpool and for the way they sailed and handled their vessel. In
addition to other damages, it was discovered on reaching the Harbour
that the 'Sheilah's' mast, with the rigging and all, had settled down 2
inches, having badly torn the wood of the mast, while 'Challenge's' mast
was also reported 'queer' aloft.</p>

<p>The No. 1 Corinthian Match, which took place in 1879, would also give
subject for much interesting reading and reflection did space permit,
for smarter seamanship or a more exciting finish could not have been
seen anywhere, not even in the bonny Clyde. It is only right to say that
the members of this little club spare no energy or pains in order to
become efficient racing yachtsmen; and to go out on a dirty afternoon to
practise under difficulties shifting sail, reefing down, sending up and
housing topmast, reefing in bowsprit and seamanship in general, is one
of the means that have been before now employed to bring about the
state of perfection which is exhibited by its <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> leading hands,
and for which the club is and always has been so famous.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighties the courses underwent some slight
alterations, and as these hold good at the present day it may be found
useful information if they are given here.</p>

<p>Of the various new classes that have sprung up within the last ten
years, perhaps that in which the 3-tonners 'Rival,' 'Duchess,' 'Senta,'
'Currytush,' and 'Mimmie' are chiefly prominent has given about the most
sport. Of these little ships, the 'Currytush,' one of the late Mr.
Payton's greatest successes, could not only show her tail to the flyers
of her class wherever she presented herself, but she gave the Solent
30-ft. class a good dressing in a thrash to windward against a nasty
head sea and in a hard blow. The small class for yachts of seven or six
tons and under has always been a great favourite in Dublin Bay, but for
two or three years a regular 5-ton class held sway, and the season of
1885 witnessed its dying kick in the coming together of the 'Shona,'
'Luath,' 'Delvin,' and 'Doris.' The 'Luath' and 'Doris' were new this
season. The 18-ft. and 25-ft. open-boat classes, however, both have run
these very fine in public favour, especially the latter. The rule of
measurement adopted, and the conditions of sailing, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span> The extreme draft is not to exceed one-sixth of the
     load-water-line.</p>

     <p>The counter, if any, is not to exceed one-sixth of
     load-water-line, nor is the rabbit, where it intersects the
     afterside of the sternpost, to come nearer the surface of
     the water than 4 in.</p>

     <p>The overhang of the bow, if any, is not to exceed one-sixth
     of the load-water-line. Any excess of overhang beyond these
     limits must be added to the length of the load-water-line,
     and the result taken for class and time-allowance.</p>

     <p>The whole overhang of any counter, whose rabbit, where it
     crosses the afterside of the sternpost, is less than 4 in.
     above the surface of the water, must be added to the length
     of the load-water-line, and the result taken as the length
     for class and time-allowance.</p>

     <p>The crew, including helmsman, is not to exceed one man for
     every 7 ft. or fraction of 7 ft. One of these may be a paid
     hand.</p>

     <p>Centreboard boats are allowed to compete, but the plates are
     never to be lowered beyond the limit of one-sixth of their
     load-water-line and must be kept down at a fixed draught
     during the whole race. (If the latter part of this rule has
     been altered, it is only lately that the alteration has been
     made.)</p>
</div>

<p>The Royal Alfred Yacht Club is still houseless, and keeps to its
original purpose of devoting all its available funds to the
encouragement of match-sailing. It has lost within the last few years
the valuable assistance of its late secretary, Mr. James A. Lyle, who
might almost be said to have fathered the club from its earliest
infancy; but with a foundation so ably laid, a working team of
thoroughly practical seamen to officer and steady the helm (and to whom
I am greatly indebted for the help given me in compiling this paper),
the members have every reason to be proud of the position their
association holds as a representative racing yacht club.</p>

<h3>"GRAPHIC CRUISERS" OF DUBLIN BAY<br>
<i>Notes by the Hon. Skipper</i></h3>

<p>A lovely night, a gentle breeze, a glassy, heaving ebb, all sail set,
the boat coaxingly pulling at her moorings, her port <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> and
starboard eyes bright and glistening, her punts (choked with artists'
sketchings, gear, and a gun-case or two) safe at the davits; her deck
rather littered with Gladstones and canvas bags; a murmuring sound from
below, accompanied by a light clatter of coffee cups: on deck are only
'Billy' (our cook), 'Jack,' the 'boy' (general fag and washer-up), and
the 'skipper' (one of the party selected by ballot for the cruise).</p>

<p>The buoy is overboard, 'Jack' hauls the stays'l to windward, Billy
lowers the chain silently through the hawse, the 'Iris' gently glides
from among the surrounding boats, and is off for a week or two, heavily
laden with an artistic, musical, medical, legal, and other 'crew'
seeking relaxation, and a recovery from that dyspepsia which sooner or
later overtakes every hard worker in this so-called temperate climate.</p>

<a id="img065" name="img065"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img065.jpg" width="400" height="259" alt="" title="">
<p>Outward bound.</p>
</div>

<p>In this boat the passengers are converted into 'crew'; all must work,
all obey the lawful commands of the skipper for the time being, though
perchance he may not be the best sailor; and although some of the
members are crack yachtsmen, all loyally <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> avoid offering
nautical advice <em>unasked</em>. Each is allotted some particular duty. One is
medical officer, another is second in command, and the most onerous task
is that accepted by the 'steward.' He is generously assisted by the
advice of such of the crew as have had experience, and has 'Billy' and
'the boy' to carry out his behests; neither of the latter appearing much
on deck, for the boat is worked in easy watches by the 'crew.'</p>

<p>It would almost appear that some insidious apology should prelude a
description of such a homely and slow craft as that selected for this
occasion; but, as she fills a space in the different classes of yachts,
and has proved an unspeakable comfort for the purposes intended, these,
and the means adopted, may have an interest for many who enjoy quiet
pursuits. The crew was a typical one. There were several artists,
several ardent naturalists, and a photographer (a lawyer, who could
prove to demonstration that a photographer <em>might</em> also be an artist),
and all practised music.</p>

<p>The cruise was limited to Dublin Bay and a few harbours north and south.</p>

<p>Some of the most beautiful spots, from an artist's point of view, cannot
be reached in a deep boat, and so our draught was limited to less than 3
ft. 6 in., a condition complied with by the 'Iris.' She is 60 ft. long
over all, with a beam of 12 ft. 6 in., diagonally built of mahogany,
with a metal keel, as well as internal ballast cast to fit her. Her
mid-transverse section shows a rather barrelled bottom, but her form
forward and aft is such that she rolls very little; and, for this
reason, and also from the fact that her saloon table is not far from the
plane of her centre of rolling motion, the swinging apparatus of the
dining-table has been removed, and it is now a satisfactory fixture.</p>

<p>As it was intended to frequent shallow waters and dry harbours like
Howth, Lambay, Rush, Skerries, Wicklow, &amp;c., provision had to be made
for taking the ground comfortably. It is not possible to do this with
'legs.' There is always a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> doubt on the mind of the responsible
officer as to which side she is likely to cant, and whilst on one side
of the boat there may be good hard sandy ground, on the other may be a
patch of soft mud, into which the leg may gently subside if she
unfortunately happen to cant in that direction. Again, the time when the
tide will leave her may be some hours hence, and a weary waiting ensues,
perhaps after a stiff passage, when all hands long to 'turn in.' Of
course, when you have a paid crew, they do the waiting; but a paid crew
in this cruise would in great measure defeat the main object of the
expedition.</p>

<a id="img066" name="img066"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img066.jpg" width="500" height="94" alt="" title="">
<p>Section of 'Iris.'</p>
</div>

<p>To obviate the necessity for 'legs,' a simple and efficient substitute
is shown in the transverse section. Two deep bilge pieces 10 feet long
are bolted to broad stringers above the timbers, and extend fore and aft
some 5 feet longer than the bilge pieces, thus distributing the strain
over a large portion of the boat. They are wide at the skin, and taper
downwards. The bolts are inserted diagonally, and the bilge pieces are
shod with keel bands; they are modelled on the outsides, but the inner
faces are flat and <em>almost</em> parallel, being further apart aft than
forward by one inch, for reasons that need not here be mentioned. Such a
contrivance helps to improve the leeway of so shallow a boat, although
not proportionately to the area immersed. It is objectionable on grounds
set forth by Kemp and others, as offering a larger surface for friction
than is the coefficient for the lateral gain; but it is a great comfort
when you have to take the ground and wish to have dinner with ease of
mind (a necessity with a dyspeptic), and a joyful exchange for the
sloppy, and lumbering, and inconvenient and unsteady 'legs.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img067.jpg" width="400" height="257" alt="" title="">
<p>Section of 'Iris,' showing permanent legs.</p>
</div>

<p>The boat is 'ketch' rigged&mdash;probably the safest of all rigs, and
certainly the simplest and least laborious to be worked by few hands;
indeed, this boat has been worked to windward in a narrow tideway,
single-handed, over and over again. This comfortable rig was determined
upon after many experiments. The boat was originally schooner-rigged,
with sails by Lapthorn; but she would not wear, at least quickly enough
for safety, in narrow waters and crooked channels, especially in strong
winds. This difficulty in 'wearing' is common to many good-sized boats.
Quite recently I saw a revenue cutter charging away towards a bank with
several hands at the tiller, and the main sheet eased off without
affecting her mad career until the officer scandalised her mainsail;
then she slowly yielded the point, and just cleared the bank by tearing
up the sand and mud, leaving a yellow track behind her. Again, during
the recent racing season, the pilot-boat (about sixty tons) started from
Kingstown Harbour for her cruising ground. The old pilot at the helm
sucked his pipe with confident air as she slipped; you could almost
imagine his saying, 'This old boat and I are old chums; I know her. See
how, with one finger on the tiller, I make her gracefully fall off to
avoid that group of yachts ahead!' Suddenly the smile disappears;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> the pipe is chucked from his mouth. She won't fall off! she is
charging bang into the yachts! The old man's legs are toughened out, and
both hands grasp the tiller, as a shout from the man forward, who is
hauling the jib to windward, calls the attention of the other pilots
aboard, and one who grasps the situation rushes to the peak-halliards
and scandalises the mainsail; then she tears away showing her copper as
she fills, while skippers around fire a volley of muttered blanks at the
'old tub' as she makes for the harbour's mouth.</p>

<p>But with the ketch-rig the helmsman of the 'Iris,' by manipulating the
mizzen-sheet, threads her in safety to or from the wind along a shallow
tortuous gut left by the fallen tide. Remember she is 60 ft. by 12 ft. 6
in., and with <em>a draught of less than 3 ft. 6 in.</em> Her ability to take
the ground upright is a source of gratification to the artistic members
of her crew; neither flowing nor ebbing tide, nor a shift of wind, makes
it necessary to alter the positions of the sketching-seats, easels are a
convenience that may be comfortably indulged in, and then the operations
of the steward are not disturbed. But there is another great advantage
in being able to take the ground in this manner when you have to stop in
harbours that are nearly half dry at low water&mdash;an advantage having a
large element of safety, and best illustrated by a case in point, an
incident in our recent cruise.</p>

<p>We had spent the night on the beach at Ireland's Eye, an island north of
Howth, rich in geological, archæological, and botanic interest. On one
side a shingle and a silver strand, a ruined abbey, and a charming view.
On the other, wild and romantic cliffs, thousands of sea birds, a
smuggler's cave, a seal cave, and a very remarkable profile rock. Here
in the summer you may see a Lord Justice picnicking with his family, a
Bankruptcy Judge, a gallant and skilful yachtsman, prowling after
rabbits, a Churchill gazing at profile rock and smoking like a furnace,
an Academician describing the hermit's cell, a citizen from Dublin
dining with his friends, an excursion of the Dublin <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span> Sketching
Club working in platoons, and, should lovely harmony startle the night
air, perhaps some members of an opera company have come down by the last
train after the performance to breathe the fresh air and sleep aboard
the 'Iris.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img068.jpg" width="400" height="282" alt="" title="">
<p>The Bailey, Dublin Bay.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, as I said, we spent the night at Ireland's Eye, and in the morning
found the barometer dropping rapidly far away at the harbour on the
mainland. The coastguards had hoisted the one point downwards,
indicating a gale from the south'ard. We were in perfect shelter, but as
we had arranged to help the Tennis Club Entertainment that afternoon by
playing some stringed instruments, we hoisted sail and made for Howth
Harbour, coming to anchor in nice time to escape the preliminary bursts
of the truthfully predicted 'blow.' The wind blew off shore, and so
there was no send or swell in the harbour. We were free to anchor in
very shallow water, careless whether we were left high and dry or not,
and herein lay our safety, not from wind nor wave, but from vessels
rushing for shelter into <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span> the small and crowded portion of the
harbour where the water is deep, and also from craft dragging.</p>

<p>Last year, during a gale off shore, eleven boats of different sizes, one
an iron steamer, dragged into a corner of the harbour and crunched one
another into matchwood. There was no '<em>sea</em>,' only a disordered and
irregular 'chop.' The 'Iris,' drawing only a few feet of water and
anchored within an inch or two of the bottom, could not be approached by
any dragging or sailing boat of greater draught; long before reaching
her they would be fast aground.</p>

1892.</p>
</div>

<p>In the evening, after our labours for our friends ashore had been
satisfactorily completed, we pulled aboard fairly dry, and in a few
moments were seated at dinner, the boat perfectly upright and immovable,
with about 2 ft. 6 in. of water around us. The lamps gave a rich glow of
colour and glitter to our table, all the more comfortable from the
contrast with the sudden cold without and the howling and moaning of the
gale. After coffee we lounged on deck, well wrapped up, to enjoy a cigar
and observe the storm. The lighthouse lamps burned brilliantly, and the
anchor lights of the craft in harbour flickered and struggled for a
feeble existence, their movements showing that over there at any rate
there was rolling and uneasiness. Here, our steadiness was enjoyable, as
was also our dry deck, due to our bulwarks of over 2 ft. high. Suddenly
above the breakwater appeared a black pyramid, growing bigger every
moment; then another, then many. They were fishing-vessels beating for
the harbour for shelter, but they slowly disappeared one by one; they
had gone about on the other tack; we might shortly expect them in. Soon
there struggled in the narrow mouth the shadow of a close-reefed trawler
of sixty tons or so. Why does she stop? Is she on the rocks at the
light? No, she has missed stays; there is not room to do more than drift
astern, and she disappears in the darkness. And in less than half an
hour she will try again, for the harbour has a difficult entrance. A few
minutes afterwards there rushes in a more fortunate vessel; then comes
another, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> and another&mdash;each in turn makes straight for us, but
we smoke quietly; we know they cannot approach. Still they are near
enough to enable us to hear, above the fighting winds, the shrill cries
of the men to 'Let draw,' or 'Hold on, Pat,' the rattling of blocks, the
vicious flap of the canvas and shock of the heavy boom as each vessel
goes about, and soon the rattling of cables as anchors are dropped,
followed by such silence as the gale permits, while the men seek some
rest after a heavy battle with nature. In the meantime the occupants of
the other boats at anchor have had serious moments; dangerously near
came some of the fishing vessels, and even when anchors had been let go
anxious eyes blinkingly peered against the salt, blinding wind to see if
the trawlers' anchors held, and that the boats were not drifting down
upon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span> them with inevitable result. Skippers also watched their
own holding gear with some concern; for if one of these crafts dragged,
she would be broken up against the breakwater, and should she be
fortunate enough to ground she would be down at the ebb, but, especially
if she were a racer, she would not rise again with the next flow. Here
we leave them and go below to our comparatively calm and safe berths,
knowing that even should it calm down by morning we shall see tired and
worn faces around us, and that we, thanks to our substitute for 'legs,'
shall have slept in ease and peace, and awakened refreshed in body and
in mind.</p>

<p>In order to get headroom there is 'trunk' 'rise' on the deck, as shown
on the cross-section drawing, 18 in. high (in one place higher) and some
40 ft. long, leaving a conveniently wide gangway on the deck at either
side; this rise has a number of dead lights at the sides, as well as
skylights above; and during its infancy the boat was severely
criticised. She was called the 'Tramcar,' and had other more opprobrious
compliments paid her. As to her speed, there were sundry allusions to
crabs and their propensities for walking backwards. It was therefore
excusable, taking into account the windage due to the superstructures
and high bulwarks, and to the general form of the boat and also to the
bilge pieces, if we had very humble notions as to the speed of the
'Iris'; and although we all believed in 'the craft you sail in,' it was
with some amazement that we found her unexpectedly fast in reaching, and
therefore fast with the wind aft. This particularly struck us one
morning when we saw a fine racing-cruiser rounding the Bailey. The wind
was fresh and free; someone said, 'Here comes Charlie. Watch how he will
swoop past us in his triumph.' But Charlie didn't triumph, neither did
he swoop; we watched carefully until we saw that <em>Charlie was going
astern!</em>&mdash;a fact that surprised us as much as it did Charlie.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img070.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="" title="">
<p>Her Majesty's Mails.</p>
</div>

<p>Again, many said that a boat with such a high freeboard and so little
draught would not claw off a lee-shore in a bad <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span> sea; but as she
was designed for artist's work chiefly in local waters, where there is
protection every four or five miles, it was not intended that she should
be submitted to heavy weather. We always had a lurking suspicion that
she would not do very well in a seaway, but here we were again agreeably
surprised; for, seizing a favourable opportunity, we brought her round
the nose of Howth (as nasty a spot as anyone could wish in dirty
weather), and there we put her through her facings, with the result that
we found her an able vessel, safe to stay even when much knocked about,
and when we purposely allowed her to make a stern board, with the aid of
the mizzen, we could put her head in which direction we chose. Several
steamers passed us during the trials, and these were shipping tons of
water, while we did not take a cupful. Around the boat, six inches below
the covering board, is a very wide 'rubbing-piece,' a ribband of 'thumb'
moulding, whose form will be understood by reference to the
cross-section drawing. This projects some inches from the side of the
boat, and the effect of this small bead in throwing off seas is most
remarkable. Often have we watched green lumps of water lapping up her
sides with a rush that threatened to bring them over the bulwarks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span> in the next instant, especially at her bows, but on reaching
this 'stroke' the whole mass seemed diverted outward, and to drop back
into the sea. True it is that action and reaction are equal and
opposite, and the momentum of the wave must have been communicated to
the boat in some way (likely to be detrimental to her speed and
affecting her leeway), but we were unable to realise practically any
injurious effect to at all balance the pleasure of a dry boat. Such,
indeed, is the general success of the boat as a quiet, safe cruiser,
that it is intended to have a new one designed by some crack authority
with better lines, built of steel, with the important existing features
adhered to, but doubtless with much improvement in the speed. As to the
rigging, the stays'l carries a boom and the sheet travels on a 'horse,'
the jibsheets run aft, and the mizzen-sheet is made fast to a cleat on
the under side of the mizzen-boom; thus the helmsman can put her about
single-handed if he please. In smooth water he puts the helm down, and,
when she fills on the other tack, shifts the jib. In a short sea, if she
is likely to lose way in stays, he puts the helm down, slips a loop over
it, then hauls on the mizzen-sheet till the sail is fore and aft, when
she goes about with certainty. He then shifts jib; he does not take the
sheet from the cleat, but simply hauls on the fall; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span>
consequently the sail does not require adjustment when the vessel fills.
In smooth water, such as the Broads or Windermere, or the Liffey
Estuary, no particular tactics are needed in going about, but in the
frequently troubled water of Dublin Bay these matters are noteworthy
when we remember that she is 60 feet long, has a beam of 12 ft. 6 in.,
and draws only 3 ft. 6 in. of water.</p>

<h3><i>Report of the Hon. Medical Officer</i></h3>

<p>In one of the steamers of which I had medical charge it was a common
saying that all that was medicinally required by the crew and passengers
was a weekly dose of 'one pint of sulphur wash and 2 oz. bilge nails,'
and that teeth might be drawn by the 'key of the kelson.' No such
drastic treatment should be required on a yachting cruise, but a few
medicines and surgical appliances should always be on board, and the
sanitary condition of the boat should be rigorously and minutely
inspected, not only before starting, but daily during the cruise, be it
long or short. To begin with, before stores or passengers come aboard I
have the carpet or other covering taken up and some of the flooring
lifted along the entire length of the boat, and I carefully see that no
fragments of food, animal or vegetable, have accidentally got about the
ballast, that no pieces of paper, however small, nor sawdust, nor
shavings, nor 'matter out of its proper place' of any kind whatever, is
left below the flooring. I personally see that the limbers are cleared,
and that a copious flush of water redolent of calcium chloride or
'Sanitas' is poured in forward and pumped out of the well aft. Next, I
inspect the sail lockers, and if there be any musty smell, I have the
sails, &amp;c., removed on deck and hung up to thoroughly dry; in the
meantime the locker beams and ceiling are washed over with a solution of
chloride of lime and thoroughly aired. The steward's store lockers and
cooking utensils are carefully examined, a solution of potassic
permanganate being freely used; the mattresses <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>(p. 137)</span> are turned over
and searched for the slightest mouldiness, and, if any be detected, are
sent ashore to be taken asunder and stoved; the lockers under the berths
are aired, and the Indian matting with which the bunks are lined taken
down and examined, and, should there be any mustiness, which will surely
be the case if it has not been kept dry, I condemn it and get
fresh&mdash;fortunately it is a cheap material. The w.c.'s are of the
underline type and consequently require rigorous examination, as that
kind is subject to leakage, and they should always be provided with
simple means for tightening up the joints, and so devised that all the
strains due to pumping, &amp;c., are self-contained. There should also be an
automatic supply of a strong solution of permanganate of potash every
time the w.c. pump is used. Besides this, however, I always make the boy
pour in a pint of strong permanganate solution night and morning, and
with a good air-draught, secured by having the door made so that there
are several inches above <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span> and below between it and its frame, I
have never had the slightest reason to doubt the efficiency of the
apparatus as a sanitary appliance. Earth-closets are a delusion; you
cannot get earth, nor even sand, when on a cruise, and there are other
serious objections. Carpets should be examined for mould in the
interstices of the material, and should any be detected, however slight,
the carpets should be taken ashore&mdash;they cannot be properly treated in a
small boat. In short, fungoid life of any kind must be stamped out, and
it is to be observed that yachts of every kind, and especially small
ones, are peculiarly subject to this kind of parasite, for it frequently
happens that boats are not inhabited, or only partially so, for some
weeks, or even months. Without fires in the cabins, or other means
adopted to withstand the moist air inseparable from the conditions, then
it is that the microscopic fungoid plants flourish.</p>

<p>Anon, fires are lighted, the air becomes dried, people move about,
currents of air sweep through the cabins, and the spores, invisible to
the naked eye, are wafted in myriads about the saloon, sleeping-cabins,
and galley, until they come to rest on some moist place, there to
propagate again if not checked. Fortunately, when the moist place
happens to be the mucous membrane of our nostrils, the spores betray
their presence, for the motion produced by the impact due to such shape
and weight and composition produce the sensations which we term 'a musty
smell.' I have frequently noticed objectionable odours of this class
about many fine yachts, and most small ones, but they are never absent
from short-voyage cross-Channel steamers; these almost invariably reek
with them to such an extent that often strong, good sailors feel ill
before the vessel leaves the wharf.</p>

<p>With such precautions as I have outlined, almost any boat may be made
'sweet.'</p>

<p>Accidents of a serious nature involving surgical aid seldom occur in
yachts; and if the cruise be a short one, a couple of needles, a
scalpel, a forceps for extracting splinters, a stronger one for
fish-hooks, a thermometer, and a long strip, two inches <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span> wide,
of india-rubber sticking-plaster rolled up in an air-tight tin-box, will
enable one to meet any case likely to arise. And for medicine I carry a
mild aperient, magnesia cit., in bottles with air-tight covers, a supply
of compound zymine (a most valuable ferment), and Burroughs's
pocket-case. Phosphates I administer by selecting the food of the person
under treatment. And I see that there is an abundant supply of fruits on
board. Often I have noticed individuals in a yachting party come aboard
for a cruise of a few weeks, all life and gaiety, and next day be quite
depressed by the reaction from the excitement and novelty of the change.
Such a person requires a little immediate treatment, or several days may
elapse before he or she will be fit to enjoy the pleasures of the
situation. It is necessary that there should be agreeable amusements to
occupy the minds of the party, when lamps are lighted and all assembled
in the saloon; and the function of providing these in some measure falls
within the doctor's duty.</p>

<p>The food should be carefully considered by the medical officer. When a
party of very young men embark on a yachting excursion they seldom pay
much attention to the quality of this necessary fuel; quantity appears
to be with them the important consideration. But when the party consists
mainly of men who have already embarked upon the responsibilities of
life, men whose brain power is severely taxed, the <i lang="fr">cuisine</i> must be
such that, although they be not persons who 'live to eat,' they can
regard the table as an additional attraction to the company surrounding
it.</p>

<p>One of the most important elements towards the smooth working of the
whole party is the presence of a lady, wife or mother or daughter of a
member; her advent has a humanizing influence on the male members,
however diverging their temperaments may be. If she be an artist or a
musician (every lady should be a musician in its best sense) and does
not object to smoking&mdash;if she be an artist she <em>won't</em>&mdash;in a properly
ventilated, not draughty, cabin, her presence will be still more
appreciated; and whether she be ashore or afloat, the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> a gentlewoman is a member of the party helps to give a peaceful
restful glamour to the whole cruise. These remarks are intended to apply
chiefly to small vessels. In large steamers, Transatlantic or others,
the duties of the medical officer are rather directed to restoring
people when they have become ill. On a yachting cruise his great aim
should be to keep people well.</p>

<h3><i>Notes by the Hon. Steward</i></h3>

<p>When I first accepted this post I felt rather inclined to resign at
once, for when the party came on board I was saluted with what were
intended to be facetious orders. It was nothing but, 'Steward! take care
of this ammunition.' 'Steward! let me have some soap and hot water; get
my bag down from deck and let me have a brandy and soda, and, look here!
be quick about it, like a good fellow.' But having often benefited by
the efforts of predecessors, I endured the good-natured badinage, which
died off after the first day. My first duty was to see that the cooking
appliances, cutlery, and table furniture were in good serviceable
condition; and I found that 'Billy' had the entire service present on
parade. The stove was a cast-iron one, a 'Fortress,' Smith &amp; Wellstood,
of Glasgow. It is a remarkable success. Though perhaps a little large
for a small boat, as a great piece of the trunk deck was removable in
fine weather, and the galley was otherwise well ventilated in cold, the
heat was never objected to&mdash;at any rate 'Billy' never mentioned it.
Catering for a cruise lasting a day or two, however large the party,
does not call for any special remark, as it is easily done; but a cruise
of more than four or five days in a yacht of limited accommodation
involves some forethought as regards a <i lang="fr">menu</i> offering a sufficient and
agreeable variety. If you can calculate on making harbour periodically,
arrangements may be made to have provisions sent from town to the
railway station, to be called for. But in that case you are tied to
call, and this fixity of programme is objected to by 'Graphics.' It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span> follows that the provisions for the whole cruise must be
carried. Now, as regards meats, flies are great enemies to the
satisfactory hanging of meat in a boat. It is surprising the number one
comes across on a coasting trip. I have often met three or four bees or
wasps far away from shore, and big bluebottles turn up in the galley,
unexpected and unwelcome guests. One of these is sufficient to make
several joints of meat very objectionable in forty-eight hours. A
perfect corrective for this state of things is a CO<sub>2</sub> box&mdash;that is, a
box like a refrigerator, fairly air-tight, and with a communication from
a small steel cylinder of compressed carbonic-acid gas; this gas is in a
liquid state, and a little is allowed to expand into the box
occasionally. So long as there is carbonic-acid gas in the box, the
lamb, or mutton, or beef, or other food, will not be troubled with
insect life, larvæ or otherwise. If it be desired to cool the contents
of the box, a good gush of the liquid gas is admitted. As it expands
into the gaseous state it absorbs heat, and a temperature of -20º C.
has thus been produced. The carbonic acid used is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> a by-product,
hitherto wasted, from the fermenting tuns of breweries. It is now
collected and pumped into steel cylinders. I am informed that before
long it will be sold for 1<i>d.</i> per pound liquid: at present the price is
3<i>d.</i> in Dublin. In practice we do not use so low a temperature as that
above mentioned, which would blister some hands, and leaves a hoar frost
over the contents of the box. We simply fill the box with gas at
ordinary temperature, taking advantage only of its antiseptic
properties. We have kept lobsters under a little pressure for six
months. At the end of that time they had not parted with the delicate
flavour of fresh lobster, and were totally unlike the tinned lobster one
buys, which, with nearly all the tinned meats I know of, will keep you
from starvation, and that is all that can be said in their behalf. The
prolonged high temperature to which they must be subjected in order to
kill the bacillic spores practically destroys the best qualities of the
natural juices. Some of the tinned vegetables are good and nutritious.
Apples, French peas, French beans, pineapples, sweet corn, potatoes,
pears, peaches, and tomatoes, arranged in order of merit as I have found
them, are invaluable in a boat; but before using them examine the tins
inside, especially those containing acid fruits. If the tins display a
beautiful crystalline pattern inside, the contents should be dropped
into cold water and rinsed for a few minutes before using. In any case
the peas and beans and apples should invariably be rinsed in an abundant
supply of cold water, and the fluid contents of the tins thrown away. It
often surprises me that the makers of tins for 'canning' purposes do not
invariably use those that are enamelled or 'glazed' inside; then there
would be no fear of metallic oxides. At present, for what reason I will
not state positively, the soups sold in tins do not agree with people.
The flavours and the different kinds certainly afford variety enough,
and would be unspeakably convenient aboard; but any experimenter, who
has not a stomach like an ostrich, will find that if he uses these for a
few days he will be ill. I make the statement without qualification.
You cannot make any kind of soup in an ordinary way <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> that will
keep in bottle. The 'extracts of meat' do not contain any nourishing
property; in fact, if you take any two animals, human or otherwise, feed
one on water only, and the other on 'extracts of meat' only, the latter
will be <em>sure</em> to die first (proven). As a consequence of all this we
find it desirable to make our soups aboard, and for that purpose carry
meats, &amp;c., in the carbonic-acid box I have described.</p>

</div>

<p>But the 'extracts of meat' <em>are</em> of great use in making rich and
delicious gravies. They may not be very economical, but that cannot be
perfectly studied in a boat, and it is possible to dress up the not too
stewed contents of the stewpot, after the soup has been poured off, with
a few capers, a little salt, a suspicion of pepper, and a thickened
gravy made of 'extract of beef,' just thick enough to make a coating
around each piece of meat&mdash;call it 'stewed beef,' or a more elaborate
name if you like&mdash;and you will find that not only will none of it be
left, but also no one will suspect it to be the remains of the soup at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span> table a quarter of an hour before. The fish we have had
meantime, it goes without saying, considering we are in Dublin Bay, is
abundant and delicious. I do not know why Dublin Bay herrings should
have such a delicate and inimitable flavour. The fish are much smaller
than the Scotch herrings and are beautifully marked, and require only a
drop or two of Harvey's sauce (Lazenby's) to bring out the proper
flavour&mdash;they are of course grilled.</p>

</div>

<p>With the small stores I have found it economical and convenient to set
aside portions for each day. Thus, if the cruise is to be for ten days,
I wrap up ten portions of cheese, for example, in air-tight paper, and
there is not a moment's loss of time when cheese is required for dinner.
Butter for each day is similarly kept in jars; that which is over after
each day is not wasted. Bread is kept in glazed earthen crocks with
covers; salt in glazed earthenware jars; tea and coffee in bottles with
air-tight screw covers; everything that can be put into an air-tight
case is so protected, and each case has a particular fitting in a
particular locker, so that no time is lost looking for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span> it, no
room is wasted, and if the boat gives a lurch or two nothing falls about
nor is spilled.</p>

<p>In a coasting cruise you can always send a boat ashore for plenty of
fresh vegetables; but, except fish, eggs, and crustacea, you cannot get
any other good provisions at any provincial place of call.</p>

<p>'Billy,' our cook, had been to sea on a coaster, where he filled a
similar berth. His ideas of the perfection of cooking took the direction
of 'plum duff,' of course taking especial care that most of the plums
were at one end, the end the skipper would be sure to select. We had no
'plum duff' in the 'Iris,' but Billy's training was of such use that
little instruction was needed to enable him to make a very respectable
orange pudding, and to deftly and lightly make a paste suitable as a
cover for any baked dish. In utilising food that is always at hand in a
cruising boat, as crabs, scollops, oysters, &amp;c., few can excel a sailor
cook after he has been carefully shown how to dress them; and to this
end it is necessary that the hon. steward should be able to perform each
operation himself. It is not sufficient to have a cookery book aboard;
as a general rule some little petty detail is omitted, it may be a
quantity, or a matter of <i lang="la">modus operandi</i>, which perplexes the operator
at the critical moment and makes the dish a solemn doubt. On the other
hand, if the hon. steward selects such recipes as he thinks will be
useful from some good cookery books, and practically tests them ashore,
he will be able to find out the weak points and amend them, and will
have the gratification to know that the crew is not doing violence to
itself by tasting his dishes in commiseration for his feelings. In small
craft it too often, indeed nearly always, happens, that the feeding
department is very crudely dealt with, and the material aliment itself
is adequately described by the half-raw, half-boiled, stale, tough,
naked generic term of 'grub.'</p>

<span class="smcap">By Thomas B. Middleton</span></h3>

<p>Kingstown is the headquarters of the Royal Alfred Yacht Club, the Royal
Irish Yacht Club, the Royal St. George Yacht Club, and several minor
sailing clubs, including the Water Wags.</p>

<p>The pleasantest part of a coast to reside on is, perhaps, that which has
a sandy beach shelving gently down into deep water. Along such a beach
in fine weather boating, bathing, and fishing are easy and enjoyable
occupations; the wavelets ripple, making soft music with the pebbles,
and the little skiff lies half in the water waiting to be stepped into
and pushed off. But such halcyon weather cannot always be counted on in
this climate. The waves are not always ripples; they quickly turn first
to breakers and then to a heavy surf, that surges up to the highest
water mark if the weather becomes at all broken or the wind comes in
from the sea, and consequently the boatman must be prepared to deal with
such a change when it occurs, and overcome the many difficulties then
presented.</p>

<p class="smcap">MERMAIDS OF DUBLIN BAY SAILING CLUB.<br>
WATER-WAG DUBLIN BAY.</p>
<p><i>All matches sailed under Rules of the</i><br>
<span class="smcap">WATER-WAG</span> <i>Club</i></p>
</div>

<p>First, the boat cannot be left anchored in the open, as she will surely
be lost or damaged in a gale. She must therefore be able 'to take the
ground handsomely'; that is, she cannot have a deep keel, for her bottom
must be broad and flat; and, secondly, she cannot have any weight of
ballast in her, as it would fatally strain her when she stranded, and
make her too heavy to draw out of the reach of the waves. Now, a boat
with no keel and no ballast makes, as everyone knows, a bad sailor; in
fact, she will only run dead before the wind like a duck's feather on
the water: so a little keel of 3 in. or 4 in. is generally used, and the
boat ballasted with sandbags filled on the beach, or stones, which are
emptied or thrown overboard before landing again. This plan has the
objections of being very laborious and making the boat very heavy to
launch. If she ships two or three seas in the operation she becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> hopelessly submerged, and the advantages gained are very
slight, as such a boat will scarcely sail closer to the wind than a
broad reach&mdash;even then making considerable leeway and being very slow
and uncertain in stays.</p>

<p>It was to improve on this state of affairs on the beach of this
description that is to be found at Shankill, in the county of Dublin,
that the 'Water Wag' was evolved from a Norwegian <em>pram</em>, into which a
boiler-plate was fitted for a centreboard as an experiment. This novel
craft was called the 'Cemiostama.' She was built in the year 1878, and
was a great success; she sailed like a witch, carried a large sail with
ease without any ballast save the iron-plate, worked well to windward
without making any leeway, spun round like a top when the tiller was put
down, and when the boiler-plate was raised she ran in on the surf,
floated in a few inches of water, and eventually sat on the strand on
her flat bottom. The plate (which weighed nearly 1 cwt.) was then lifted
out of her, and she became as light to haul up as an ordinary shore
skiff.</p>

<p>It was accordingly decided to build seven or eight centreboard
double-ended 13-ft. punts with great beam (4 ft. 10 in.), full lines,
and a flat floor. The 13 ft. was chosen as the best size that two
persons could haul up without help, a larger boat being too heavy for
two, and consequently liable to damage by being left in the surf while
help was being obtained; and the round stern was to divide the surf when
the forepart stranded, and prevent it jumping into the boat as it does
in the case of a square stern.</p>

<p>In order that these boats might have an occasional race between
themselves, to preserve the type and to save the expense of outbuilding
and the trouble of handicapping and time allowance, it was further
arranged that all the boats should be built on the same lines, and the
canvas limited to a cruising amount. This was accordingly done, and they
proved themselves to be such good seaboats, and so generally useful for
two or three amateurs to amuse themselves along the shore in, that 'The
Water Wag Association' was started in 1887, to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span> further develope
and preserve the principles of the class. Though it was started by boys,
several older Wags joined, and as the boat was never designed for speed,
the racing was not originally intended to be hard-down serious sport,
but more a sort of friendly sail round a course in boats all alike, and
that consequently should be all together; but of course skill in working
would bring one to the front and make her harder to catch. Hence the
rollicking title 'Water Wag,' and the institution of a king and queen,
bishops, knights, and rooks, to manage the affairs of the club, their
chief duties being to get up as much fun and as many jolly water
excursions as possible.</p>

<p>The first two or three seasons saw this idea carried out with great
success; but gradually the racing grew more keen and serious, until it
eventually became the sole object for which the boats assembled, so much
so that it is now nothing but racing from early in April till late in
September. The Water Wags' own races are held round Kingstown Harbour
(the head quarters having migrated there when the generation which
formed the Shankill Corinthian Sailing Club grew up and disintegrated
over the world); others are got up for them by the Dublin Bay Sailing
Club in Scotchman's Bay, outside the harbour, and there are races at the
local regattas at Kingstown, Dalkey Bray, Greystones, Wicklow, Clontarf,
Howth, and Malahide; so that since the class was started they have had
nearly 300 competitions.</p>

<p>They have greatly increased in numbers, and have become quite a local
type of small boats in Kingstown, as they work in and out through the
yachts and shipping, and are very handy to take four or five persons in
to listen to the bands from the water.</p>

<p>They are not confined to Kingstown Harbour, however, as they have sent
representatives to the River Plate, Hong Kong, the Persian Gulf,
Australia, and many foreign ports. Their principle has been largely
adopted in the B division of the Dublin Bay Sailing Club, which
consists of 18-ft. boats, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span> called 'Mermaids,' which are
practically large Water Wags, being entirely open, with 6-feet beam,
fitted with centreboard and carrying no ballast. These have a limited
racing sail-area of 180 feet, but they are not further confined as to
shape, and some have the rounded stern and some the square. They are
very fast, lively boats, requiring a crew of three or four nimble hands,
principally to be employed in shifting ballast, and they give a great
deal of sport, as many as twelve or fourteen starting in a race every
Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>The 'Water Wag' costs complete between 15<i>l.</i> and 20<i>l.</i>, a silk racing
lug from Lapthorn and Ratsey alone coming to 2<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> McAllister, of
Dumbarton, built most of them; but Atkinson, of Bullock, Co. Dublin, and
Doyle, of Kingstown, have built many more.</p>

<p>In handling, the skipper&mdash;especially if he is a tiro at the art&mdash;must be
very careful, as 75 sq. ft. of canvas, and a 13-ft. mast in a 13-ft.
boat, without ballast, require attention and caution if there are any
puffs knocking round; so that the mainsheet must never be made fast, no
matter how fine and calm the weather is; the halliards should also run
very free, and the oars should always be carried, in case it becomes
judicious to lower the sail in a squall. But a little practice will
enable the skipper to sail his boat without danger during weather that
any small open boat can be out in; and it is really marvellous what
weather and seas the Water Wags have gone through.</p>

<p>Sailing out of sight of help in any small open boat is to be deprecated,
and no exception to this rule is to be made with Water Wags, as they
unquestionably run a risk of filling in unskilful hands; but, in that
event, the absence of ballast is an advantage, for they do not go to the
bottom as a ballasted boat will, but will actually support their crew if
no attempt is made to climb up on them.</p>

<p>A lug of 60 sq. ft. is ample to begin with; and for most days when not
racing, and for single-handed sailing, a reef should be taken in, or two
kegs of water-ballast carried, unless on a very fine day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span> The following sailing regulations are carefully enforced during
racing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>Only the boats of members shall compete in the races, and as
     it is one of the fundamental principles of the Water Wags
     that the boats shall be similar in every respect save
     sail-plan, it shall be in the power of the officer of the
     day to disqualify any boat that, in his opinion, is trying
     to gain an unfair advantage by infringing the above
     principle.</p>

     <p>Each boat shall not carry more than three or less than two
     persons during a race, all of whom shall be amateurs, and
     shall be steered by either a member or a lady. And no money
     shall be awarded to a boat for a walk-over, but she may fly
     a flag therefor. Each boat shall carry on all proceedings of
     the Water Wags, all her platforms, floorings, thwarts, and
     stern sheets, also a pair of oars not less than 9 ft. long,
     with spurs or rowlocks for same; also, either one solid cork
     ring-shaped life-buoy, not less than 30 in. in external
     diameter, and capable of floating for three hours 21 lbs. of
     iron suspended therefrom, or two smaller ones of the same
     material and shape, which shall each float for the same time
     14 lbs. of iron; or they may substitute a cork life-belt
     that will float 10 lbs. for three hours for each of the
     small life-buoys, providing each life-belt is worn the
     entire time the boat is afloat. Before taking a prize the
     owner of the boat shall declare to the party awarding it
     that the spirit of this rule has been carried out. And it
     shall also be the duty of every other competitor to protest
     against a boat without a life-buoy. The life-buoys shall
     rest unattached to anything in the boat, with nothing over
     or resting on them, so that they will immediately float out
     in the event of a capsize.</p>

     <p>All persons on board who cannot swim 100 yards are requested
     to <em>wear</em> life-jackets.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE THAMES CLUBS AND WINDERMERE</span></h2>

<h3>THE ROYAL THAMES YACHT CLUB<br>
<span class="smcap">By Edward Walter Castle and Robert Castle</span></h3>

<p>In the year 1775 was founded the 'Cumberland Fleet,' and as the Royal
Thames Yacht Club is its lineal descendant, the latter may with all
justice claim the title of the 'Mother of Yacht-racing,' at least in
Great Britain.</p>

<p>The year 1770 was a most important epoch in Thames yachting, and we
think the lines and drawing of our first cup-winning yacht should be
given here. The 'King's Fisher,' <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span> as the sketch shows, was
clinker built. Her owner, Commodore Thomas Taylor of the Cumberland
Fleet, was so thoroughly the practical founder of yacht racing on the
Thames that his statue should be placed on the Thames Embankment&mdash;with a
bronze plaque of his yacht and the cups he won&mdash;and if times are too bad
to go that length, a medallion portrait plaque could go on the Temple
Embankment Arch, for the 'King's Fisher' was built close by. Her
dimensions, as shown in her lines, were, length 20 ft., beam 7 ft.</p>

<p>The Cumberland Fleet, or, as it is often called, the Cumberland Sailing
Society, was founded under the following circumstances.</p>

<p>In the year of grace 1775 the first rowing regatta that was ever held in
England took place upon the Thames&mdash;on June 23. Previously to this,
however, a meeting of 'several very respectable gentlemen, proprietors
of sailing vessels and pleasure boats on the river,'<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4" title="Go to footnote 4"><span class="smaller">[4]</span></a> held their
annual meeting at Battersea, and resolved that on the regatta day they
would draw up in a line opposite Ranelagh Gardens, so as not to be in
the way of the competing rowing boats. On July 6 of the same year an
advertisement appears in the 'Advertiser,' that his Royal Highness Henry
Frederick, Duke of Cumberland (a brother of George III., and an admiral
in the British Navy) was about to give a silver cup<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5" title="Go to footnote 5"><span class="smaller">[5]</span></a> to be sailed for
on July 11. The advertisement is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">
     A Silver Cup, the gift of His Royal Highness the Duke of
     Cumberland, is to be sailed for on Tuesday, the 11th
     instant, from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span> Westminster Bridge to Putney Bridge
     and back, by Pleasure Sailing Boats, from two to five tons
     burthen, and constantly lying above London Bridge. Any
     gentleman inclined to enter his Boat may be informed of
     particulars by applying to Mr. Roberts, Boat-builder,
     Lambeth, any time before Saturday Noon next.</p>

</div>

<p>On account of the weather, however, the race was postponed until July
13, when it came off with great success, and the 'Aurora,' owned by a
Mr. Parkes, described as 'late of Ludgate Hill,' won the cup. The second
boat in was named the 'Fly,' but who owned her the newspapers of the day
forgot to mention. From 'the Morning Post'<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6" title="Go to footnote 6"><span class="smaller">[6]</span></a> we get the information
that only those boats 'which were never let out to hire' would be
allowed to enter, and also that 'the Gentlemen, about 18 or 20 in
number, who sail for the prize have come to a resolution to be dressed
in aquatic uniforms.' This seems to prove that the club had already been
formed before the match, and was probably an outcome of the club at
Battersea mentioned above. We also find from the old newspapers that the
owners (who, by the way, were always styled 'captain') had to steer
their respective vessels, and in the case of this first match were
allowed two assistants; so it would seem that what nowadays are called
'Corinthian rules' were in the early period of yacht-racing a <i lang="la">sine quâ
non</i>.</p>

<p>There were very solemn ceremonies attending all these early races. The
Duke embarked on board his state barge from one of the stairs, and the
royal standard was immediately hoisted at the bow. Another barge was in
company with a band of music, and they then proceeded to the place of
starting. The racing boats were anchored in line, with their sails
furled; their places having beforehand been determined by lot. Each
vessel, when racing, carried at her gaff a white flag with a red St.
George's Cross upon it, and with one, two, three, or more blue balls,
according to her position at starting. The captains were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span>
stationed in wherries, and on the arrival of the Duke's barge were by
signal ordered on board their respective vessels. Then, on the firing of
a gun, the race was started. Time allowance was an unknown quantity in
those primitive days, and the boat which succeeded in passing the
winning-post first claimed the cup. The victorious captain was then
taken on board the commodore's barge, and with great ceremony introduced
to his Royal Highness. In the meantime the Duke's butler had filled the
cup with claret and handed it to his Royal Highness, who thereupon drank
the health of the winner, and then presented him with the cup. The
captain then drank to the Duke and Duchess, with three cheers; the whole
ceremony having been performed amidst the strains of martial music,
salvos of artillery, and the huzzas of the crowd upon the river and its
banks. The fleet then proceeded up the stream to Smith's Tea Gardens,
which lay where the gasworks now are, on the Surrey side of Vauxhall
Bridge, and dined together. The Duke himself was very often present at
these festive gatherings, and later on in the evening they all visited
Vauxhall Gardens and made a night of it. The first commodore of the club
was a Mr. Smith, who, we believe, was the proprietor of Smith's Tea
Gardens, and he probably held the office until 1779. That year the
commodore's broad pennant was changed from red to blue, and the club
dined at the Royal Oak, Vauxhall, which seems to show a change of
officers. Anyhow, the following year, 1780, Mr. Thomas Taylor was
commodore, as is shown by the cup he won,<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7" title="Go to footnote 7"><span class="smaller">[7]</span></a> and he held that office
until the year 1816, when he gave up yachting. The Cumberland Fleet had
the white ensign, but without the St. George's Cross in the fly, and
their burgee was a white one, with an equal armed red cross on it; i.e.
the cross did not come out to the point of the flag. At the Royal Thames
Club House they have several relics of the ancient fleet; there is the
chairman's ivory gavel with the inscription 'Cumberland Fleet,' which
is still used at every annual meeting; there are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> also (besides
some curious prints and pictures) a cap of one of the rowers of the
commodore's barge, and a club button, though it is not known whether it
belonged to one of the rowers or to a member of the club. The Cumberland
course originally was, as we have already shown, from Westminster Bridge
to Putney and back, but in 1776 it was altered to Blackfriars Bridge,
Putney, and back. Later on, the winning-post was at Smith's Tea Gardens,
by that time called Cumberland Gardens.</p>

<p>The fleet evidently used to sail together and man&oelig;uvre as well as
race, for in 1776, in honour of His Majesty's birthday, 'they went up
the river with colours flying and music playing'; and in 1793 a set of
signals were printed (a copy of which may be seen framed at the Royal
Thames Club House) whereby the commodore could man&oelig;uvre the sailing
boats like a fleet of men-o' war; indeed there is a print extant, dated
1778, wherein the fleet are being so man&oelig;uvred off Sheerness.</p>

<p>The first private match, under the auspices of the club, seems to have
come off, between two of the sailing boats, on April 20, 1776, but no
mention is made of their names. Some of the expressions used in the
newspapers about the different matches are very curious; in one paper it
is called 'Fluviatic and Fresh Water Frolics,' and in another 'Thamesian
Pleasantry,' and again, 'Water-racing Galloways,' but the best of the
lot is in the 'Morning Post'<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8" title="Go to footnote 8"><span class="smaller">[8]</span></a> of 1782, where the race is described as
'a Fluviatic Cavalcade.'</p>

</div>

<p>The yachts belonging to the Cumberland Fleet did not confine themselves
to river sailing, for in one of the papers of 1777 it is stated that
the 'Hawke' had been cruising about the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>(p. 159)</span> Channel, and had been
chased into Calais by an American privateer. The Duke of Cumberland gave
a silver cup each year, of the value of twenty guineas; but in 1781,
when the seventh became due, a silver-gilt cup of the value of fifty
guineas was presented to the club by His Royal Highness. This was to be
sailed for by the boats that had won the former prizes, and the
advertisement goes on to say, 'The members of the Society do hereby,
with the permission of His Royal Highness, challenge and invite all
gentlemen, proprietors of pleasure sailing boats, within the British
dominions, to join with them in the contention.'<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9" title="Go to footnote 9"><span class="smaller">[9]</span></a> The first attempt at
this race on June 25 failed for want of wind, and the match had to be
re-sailed on July 9, when the cup was won by the 'Cumberland,' belonging
to Commodore Taylor. This race, the first open match ever sailed, seems
to have caused a good deal of excitement, and the river and its banks
were densely crowded. The papers of the day speak of the many thousands
present, of all sorts, 'from the peerless "Perdita" to the Princess
"Ran."'<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10" title="Go to footnote 10"><span class="smaller">[10]</span></a></p>

<p>For some unexplained reason, 1782 was the last year that the Duke gave a
cup to the 'Fleet.'<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11" title="Go to footnote 11"><span class="smaller">[11]</span></a> He certainly remained its patron up to his death
in 1790, but he ceased to take any personal interest in the affairs of
the club. This cup was won by the 'Caroline,'<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12" title="Go to footnote 12"><span class="smaller">[12]</span></a> belonging to Captain
Coffin, and seems to have had a curious history, as in 1886 it was
discovered in a pawnshop at San Francisco, and, it is said, was bought
and raced for by some yacht club in America. On August 10, 1782, the
first below-bridge match of the Cumberland Fleet took place. It was
between the 'Caroline,' Captain Coffin, and the 'Eagle,' Captain Grubb,
for a wager of 40<i>l.</i>: the course being from Cuckolds Point to the Lower
Hope, and back again. The 'Caroline' won easily.</p>

<p>The years 1783 to 1785 have no matches recorded against <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> the
club. On August 21, 1784, the commodore's boat the 'Cumberland' went
badly ashore on the rocks off Margate.<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13" title="Go to footnote 13"><span class="smaller">[13]</span></a> She must, however, have been

Tyars became proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens, and to celebrate the
jubilee of the Gardens (which had been open just fifty years), and also
the new management, he gave an annual silver cup and cover, to be sailed
for by the Cumberland Fleet, and a wherry to be rowed for by the
watermen on the Thames.</p>

<p>The one thing curious about this match is that the 'Prince of Wales'
sailing boat was advertised for sale, and it goes on to say, 'which no
doubt will have the best chance to win the Jubilee Silver Cup which will
be sailed for on the 17th inst.' She won that cup!</p>

<p>The proprietors of Vauxhall Gardens continued giving an annual cup to
the club until the year 1810, when the last prize offered by them was
sailed for on August 6, and won by the 'St. George,' 7 tons, Captain
James Gunston. The ceremonies attached to the giving of the Vauxhall Cup
differed but slightly from those attending the Duke of Cumberland's
prize. The race started, as before, from Blackfriars Bridge and sailed
round a boat stationed near Putney Bridge and back past a boat moored
off Vauxhall Stairs, next door to Cumberland Gardens.</p>

<p>The gardens in the evening were magnificently illuminated; a wonderful
transparency of the sailing match was on show, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span> and the former
prize cups won by the club were arranged on pedestals in front of it.
There are many incidents connected with the Cumberland Fleet during all
these years. The 'Morning Chronicle'<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15" title="Go to footnote 15"><span class="smaller">[15]</span></a> says: 'There was an attempt of
foul play against the "Prince of Wales," the winning vessel of 1786, by
other boats getting in her way, but she got all clear by a liberal use
of handspikes.' In 1787 the match on July 19 was ordered by the club to
be re-sailed August 3, on account of some mistakes in the sailing
directions made by the competing yachts; this was eventually won by the
'Nancy,' Captain Dore, but the 'Blue Dragon' was disqualified for
booming out her jib.</p>

<p>There must have been some form of Admiralty warrant extant in those
days, as we find that the members of the club are requested (in an
advertisement) to meet at the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand, and
it goes on to say,<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16" title="Go to footnote 16"><span class="smaller">[16]</span></a> 'The gentlemen who enter their boats are to
attend at the same time to draw lots for situation at starting; and are
hereby informed that they are expected either to produce their licence
from the Admiralty, or other proofs of being owners of the vessels they
intend to sail.'</p>

<p>In 1791,<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17" title="Go to footnote 17"><span class="smaller">[17]</span></a> Commodore Taylor, with a party of friends, started in the
'Cumberland' for Bordeaux, but we have found no reference to his having
arrived there. This year there was a dreadful accident at the race for
the Vauxhall Cup, by the bursting of a cannon at Cumberland Gardens, at
the moment that the 'Mercury,' Captain Astley, was winning; by this two
persons lost their lives. This is also the first year in which a second
prize was given, viz. a silver goblet. The year 1793 was kept as a
septennial one, and a handsome silver-gilt cup was presented to be raced
for; the club thereupon challenged the world.</p>

<a id="img086" name="img086"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img086.jpg" width="350" height="445" alt="" title="">
<p>Circular of Cumberland Fleet, 1775.</p>
</div>

<p>On July 27, 1793, the 'Cumberland,' Commodore Taylor, and the
'Eclipse,' Captain Astley, had a match for a turtle, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> which the
commodore won, and the members of the Club had a turtle feast on the
strength of it. In 1794 the proprietors of Vauxhall put a wonderful car
upon the river, on the match day. It was drawn by tritons and was moved
by invisible oars. It contained, besides bands of music, Father Thames
attended <span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>(p. 164)</span> by his river gods; and for several years this
appeared, but with different devices.</p>

<p>A curious light is let in by the newspapers of 1795<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18" title="Go to footnote 18"><span class="smaller">[18]</span></a> on the way they
managed matters when racing. The 'Mercury,' which was the leading boat,
somehow got foul of the 'Vixen'; whereupon the captain of the 'Vixen'
cut away the rigging of the 'Mercury' with a cutlass and fairly well
dismantled her, another boat, the 'Mermaid,' winning the cup. We have
failed entirely to find any sort of protest against such high-handed
proceedings. There was another cup presented to the Club besides the
Vauxhall one in 1796; it was given by the proprietor of Cumberland
Gardens. A match for a wager of forty guineas took place on August 11,
1797,<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19" title="Go to footnote 19"><span class="smaller">[19]</span></a> between the 'Mercury' and the 'Providence,' from the Gun Wharf
at Blackwall round the Nore Light and back; this was won easily by the
'Mercury,' which did the distance in 12 hrs. 5 mins., beating the
'Providence' by twenty miles.</p>

<p>The year 1800 was again kept as a septennial one, or, as the papers
prefer to call it, a 'Jubilee,' and there is in existence a print of the
'Cumberland,' Captain Byrne, winning the cup. Mr. E. Smith, owner of the
'Atalanta,' which won the Vauxhall Cup in 1801, presented the same year
a cup to be raced for, and it was won by the 'Mercury,' Captain Astley.
Another septennial (or Jubilee) cup was given by the proprietors of
Vauxhall Gardens in 1807, and this fell to the 'Bellissima,' owned by
Captain Farebrother. This year the contractors for the State Lottery
gave a cup to be raced for on the Thames, and all the boats entered for
it belonged to the Cumberland Fleet. A new public Garden was started in
1809, called the Minor Vauxhall, and Mr. Sheppard, its proprietor, gave
a silver cup to be sailed for on the river. The first two attempts
failed to come off, but at the third and final one the 'St. George,'
Captain Gunston, won the prize. The last cup given by the proprietors of
Vauxhall Gardens, in 1810, was won by the 'St. George,' and the same
year Mr. Sheppard (who had changed the name of his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span> Gardens to
'The New Ranelagh') again gave a cup, which was won by the 'Sally,'
belonging to Captain Hammond. The proprietor of the New Ranelagh Gardens
also gave cups in the years 1811 and 1812, and although the club is not
mentioned in connection with them, none but vessels belonging to the
Cumberland Fleet were entered. On July 16, 1812, the club gave two cups,
by subscription, to be raced for from Blackwall to Gravesend and back,
which were won respectively by the 'Mercury' and the 'Vixen.' As the
years roll on the newspapers get rather confused about the sailing
matches, and the name of the old club very rarely occurs, although we
have seen an account book where the subscription of one guinea is
mentioned as having been paid to the secretary of the Cumberland Fleet,
in the year 1818.</p>

<p>The years 1814, 1821, and 1822 have no sailing matches recorded against
them, but these, with 1783 to 1785, are the only ones in which we have
failed to find a race of some sort or other. After Commodore Taylor's
retirement it is believed that Mr. Edward Nettlefold was elected in his
place, but there is, great confusion on the subject, for in 1817 he is
called commodore of the 'London Yacht Club,' which in another number of
the same paper is called the 'New Cumberland Fleet.' Most probably there
had been some dissensions among the members of the club, but whatever
had happened, there is no getting over the fact that in the year 1823
the Cumberland Fleet had a below-bridge race, and that it was under the
direction of Commodore Edward Nettlefold.</p>

<p>The year 1823 is a most important one in the history of the club. On
July 17 there was a race for a silver cup in honour of the King's
coronation,<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20" title="Go to footnote 20"><span class="smaller">[20]</span></a> and the newspapers<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21" title="Go to footnote 21"><span class="smaller">[21]</span></a> go on to say:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">
     The 'Favourite' steam packet, soon after ten o'clock, came
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span> down from the Tower. This boat was elegantly
     decorated, and was crowded with ladies. The gentlemen of the
     'Old Cumberland Fleet' were on board, under the direction of
     their respected Commodore, Edward Nettlefold, Esquire, under
     whose direction the match took place.</p>

<p>The cup was won by the 'Venus,' belonging to Captain George Keen. In the
'Public Ledger' of July 17, 1823, is the following advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="center"><i>HIS MAJESTY'S CORONATION</i></p>

     <p>The Subscribers and Members of the Old Cumberland Fleet will
     dine together at the Ship Tavern, Water Lane, Tower Street,
     this day at four o'clock precisely to celebrate the
     coronation of His Most Gracious Majesty King George IV.;
     when the superb silver cup, sailed for in honour of that
     event, on Thursday last, from Blackwall to Coal House Point,
     below Gravesend and back, by gentlemen's pleasure vessels,
     will be presented to Captain George Keen, the winner of the
     prize; and to arrange the articles for the sailing match to
     take place on Wednesday afternoon, the 30th instant, and to
     start at three o'clock from Blackfriars Bridge, and sail to
     Putney and back to Cumberland Gardens, under the especial
     patronage of the proprietors of the Royal Gardens,
     Vauxhall.'</p>
</div>

<p>At this dinner the club must have decided to change their name, as
appears from the following extract from a Vauxhall programme of July 30,
1823, announcing the match 'given by His Majesty's Coronation Sailing
Society, entered into for celebrating annually the Coronation, and
formed by new subscribers and members of the old Cumberland Fleet'; the
last three words being printed right across the page in large type. They
also changed their flag, adopting a white one with a crown in the upper
corner next the staff, with the letters 'G.R. IV.' underneath, and the
words 'Coronation Fleet' in the fly. This flag had a crimson border all
round, with lettering of the same colour.</p>

</div>

<p>This match of July 30, 1823, is a very important one, as, owing to a
dispute over the prize, the present Royal Thames <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> Yacht Club was
formed. The facts are as follows:&mdash;In the race the 'St. George,' Captain
Brocklebank, came in first, and the 'Spitfire,' Captain Bettsworth, was
the second boat. Captain Bettsworth, however, protested against the 'St.
George' being given the prize, for the following reasons:&mdash;'That the
"St. George" during the match was steered by two persons, which was
contrary to the sailing articles signed by all the competitors
previously to starting. The articles alluded to state that "the vessels
must be sailed by their respective owners, or by any person they may
think proper to appoint." The appellant states the breach of articles to
have been committed between Blackfriars and Waterloo Bridges.'<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22" title="Go to footnote 22"><span class="smaller">[22]</span></a> On
August 6 the Club met to consider the question at the Ship Tavern, Water
Lane; and after Capt. Bettsworth had produced witnesses and the matter
had been argued out, it was determined by ballot, and by a majority of
one, that the race should be re-sailed on Monday, August 11. On August
7, however, a protest was sent to the commodore, signed by seven members
of the club (none of whom, by the way, had a boat in the match), asking
him to call another meeting of the society, to either confirm or rescind
the vote on August 6, and mentioning the fact that Captain Brocklebank
had not been present at the ballot. On August 8 another meeting was
held, at the Ship Tavern, of the captains and owners of the pleasure
boats that had been in the race of July 30; they resolved to send in a
protest to Commodore Nettlefold, in which they stated 'that if such
resolution be rescinded, we have unanimously determined never to enter
any of our boats for any cup to be given on any future occasion by the
"Coronation" Fleet,' as they considered the merits of the question had
been fully and fairly discussed. This protest was signed by eight of the
captains who sailed in the match. On August 9 a further meeting of the
club was held, and the resolution of the 6th instant rescinded, in
spite of the protest, the cup being handed over <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> to Captain
Brocklebank as the victor. On this decision the captains held another
conference (probably on the evening of August 9), decided to form a new
club, and to call a special meeting on the question. On August 14, 1823,
at the White Horse Tavern, Friday Street, it was decided to form such
new club, and to call it the 'Thames Yacht Club.' Most of the old
members of the 'Cumberland' Fleet are supposed to have joined it. The
'Coronation' Fleet went on with varying fortunes until the year 1827,
when it seems to have fallen into abeyance; but it was revived again in
1830 with a great flourish of trumpets, only to be absolutely dissolved
on January 3, 1831, at a meeting of the club, held at the British Coffee
House, Charing Cross; and that very same year their commodore, Lord
Henry Cholmondeley, was racing as an ordinary member of the Thames Yacht
Club. So that those members of the 'Coronation' Fleet who did not join
in 1823 were finally absorbed in the Thames Yacht Club in 1831. Since
that period the life of the club has flowed along pretty evenly, with a
few ups and downs, like the noble river from which it takes its name.
The first match of the Thames Yacht Club was held on September 9, 1823,
for a cup valued at 25 guineas, when ten boats entered. They sailed the
old course from Blackfriars Bridge, and finished at Cumberland Gardens;
but in this case, for want of wind, the match had to be re-sailed on the
10th, when the cup was won by the 'Spitfire,' Mr. T. Bettsworth. The
following year they had an above- and a below-bridge match, and this was
regularly continued until 1840, after which the above-bridge match was
given up. The 'Don Giovanni,' owned by Mr. J. M. Davey, won cups in
1824 and 1826; she was considered the crack <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> boat of her day,
and there is a song in existence which ends as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>Now toast the Don Giovanni's crew, who bear the prize away,<br>
  And may they always sail as well as they have sail'd to-day!<br>
  Then fill each glass with sparkling wine, and bumpers let them be,<br>
  And drink to Captain Davey's health&mdash;his health with three times three:</p>

<p class="add5em">For the cup is won, the match is done,<br>
         <span class="add1em">And settl'd is the rub;</span><br>
      Let mirth abound, and glee go round.<br>
         <span class="add1em">In this&mdash;the Thames Yacht Club.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In 1827 a 50-guinea cup was given to be raced for, from Blackwall to
Gravesend and back, to celebrate the event of His Royal Highness the
Duke of Clarence becoming patron of the Thames Yacht Club. This was won
by the 'Lady Louisa,' belonging to Mr. T. Smith.</p>

<p>The following year there was a split off from the club, caused by their
refusal to give prizes for very small boats, so the seceders formed the
Clarence Yacht Club, which existed for several years. On August 28,
1830, two cups were given to be raced for below bridge, in honour of the
Duke of Clarence coming to the throne as William IV. The yachts sailed
in two classes, the first of which was won by the 'Matchless,' 19 tons,
Mr. J. Hyatt; and the second by the 'Brilliant,' 8 tons, Mr. W.
Bucknall. On October 7 of the same year, at a meeting of the club, it
was resolved 'that the uniform button should be altered from T.Y.C. to
R.T.Y.C.'; in other words, they had become the 'Royal Thames Yacht
Club.' This year the fleet of the club consisted of forty-three vessels.</p>

</div>

<p>The burgee of the Thames Yacht Club was probably a red one, with the
letters T.Y.C., as we find that on February 3, 1831, a red burgee was
agreed to having the letters R.T.Y.C. under a crown. There were two cups
given by the club, on September 15, 1831, to celebrate the coronation of
their Majesties William IV. and his Queen. The first was won by the
'Lady Louisa,' and the second by the 'Water Witch.' In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span> December
1834 a white burgee was adopted with a crown and the letters R.T.Y.C. in
red; and on February 19, 1835, an Admiralty warrant was granted to the
club authorising their vessels to carry a white ensign without a red
cross, but with the union-jack in the upper corner, and bearing in the
fly a crown over the letters R.T.Y.C. in red. William IV. died on June
20, 1837, and on July 27 of the same year Her Majesty Queen Victoria
became patroness of the club. The following year special prizes were
given in honour of the Queen's coronation, and there is in possession of
the club a portrait of Commodore Harrison holding the cup in his hand.
In 1840 a challenge cup of the value of 100 guineas was given, to be won
twice consecutively by the same yacht, without reference to ownership.
It was eventually secured by the 'Secret,' Mr. J. W. Smith, on June 8,
1847. The Admiralty took away the white ensign from the Royal Thames
Yacht Club in 1842 (as well as from several other clubs that had the
right of flying it), and only allowed the Royal Yacht Squadron to
continue its use. In July of the same year, however, the Admiralty
granted to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span> the Royal Thames a blue ensign with a crown in the
fly. On June 30, 1845, a cup of the value of 60<i>l.</i> was presented by
Earl Fitzhardinge, and the yachts had to be manned, steered, and handled
by members of the club only. The 'Belvidere,' 25 tons; the 'Prima
Donna,' 25 tons; the 'Phantom,' 20 tons; and the 'Widgeon,' 24 tons,
were entered, the cup being won by the 'Belvidere,' belonging to
Vice-Commodore Lord Alfred Paget. In the year 1848 the Admiralty granted
to the club a further warrant, dated July 24, giving them the plain
'blue ensign of Her Majesty's Fleet,' and of this they still enjoy the
use. Time allowance first appears in the matches of the Royal Thames on
June 29, 1849, in a race from Erith to the Nore and back, when half a
minute per ton for difference of tonnage was allowed. July 8, 1851, the
Queen for the first time gave a cup to be raced for by the club, the
course being from Erith, round the Nore and back; it was won by the
'Cygnet,' 35 tons, owned by Mr. H. Lambton, M.P. The club established an
annual schooner match, which was held regularly for several years, the
first having been on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> June 1, 1853. In 1855 the club had 170
yachts in its fleet, but in 1861 they had reached to 241 vessels; at the
present date they are some 350 strong. In 1862 the 'Marina,' on rounding
the Nore lightship, ran into the club steamer, the 'Prince of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span>
Wales,' damaging herself considerably, and had to be towed back. As she
was leading vessel at the time, and it was the fault of the steamer
getting in the way, she received a special prize. On May 21, 1866, the
first Nore to Dover race of the club took place, although they had one
or two matches to Harwich and the Isle of Wight before that date. At the
beginning of 1868 there was another split in the Royal Thames, and those
who left established the 'New Thames Yacht Club,' which is still in
existence. The same year the club was again honoured by the presentation
of a Queen's Cup, which was raced for from Gravesend to the Mouse and
back. In 1874 His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales became commodore,
and for the first time in the history of the club a rear-commodore was
elected, Mr. Thomas Brassey. Queen's Cups have also been given to the
club in 1874, 1880, and 1885; but in the year 1887, on the occasion of
Her Majesty's Jubilee, the club, to mark that event, gave a special
prize of 1,000 guineas in an ocean match round Great Britain, the
winning-post being at Dover. This was won by the 'Genesta,' belonging to
Sir Richard Sutton, Bart.</p>

<h3>ROYAL CORINTHIAN YACHT CLUB, ERITH<br>
<span class="smcap">By R. T. Pritchett</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps one of the most sporting clubs on the Thames or elsewhere is the
Royal Corinthian Yacht Club, which has its headquarters at Erith. This,
the original Corinthian Club, was formed in May 1872; but several other
clubs have since been started at various ports, and have copied the
title with the affix of the place to which they belong.</p>

<p>During the first year some 200 members were enrolled, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span> but the
number rapidly increased, and the club has now close upon 500 members,
and possesses a valuable freehold club-house standing in an acre of
ground on the banks of the Thames at Erith. The house includes a large
club-room, nearly 70 feet long, a committee room, and a bunk-room for
the use of members wishing to sleep there. Underneath are extensive
stores, with twenty large sail lockers, each capable of holding the gear
of a 20-tonner. These are let to members at 30s. per annum. There is
room in the grounds for any number of the smaller fry which are not too
heavy to be hauled over the wall, and they have a good snug berth here
for the winter.</p>

<p>The classification of the yachts for racing purposes does not extend to
anything exceeding 20-rating, and for this size of vessel only one paid
hand is allowed. The remainder of the crew, including the helmsman, must
be members of the club.</p>

<p>In the first year or so of the club's existence the racing was mostly
confined to the smaller classes, and the 5-ton 'Arrow,' at that time
head of her class, was a frequent competitor. About this period the
'Adèle' and the 'Ada' were in the Thames. These gave way in turn to the
'Virago,' 6 tons, 'May,' 6 tons, and the 'Alouette' and 'Freda,' each 5
tons. The 10-ton 'Zephyr' then came up into the river, and had some hard
tussles to save her time from the smaller vessels; and Major Lenon's
'L'Erie,' 10 tons, also competed occasionally with success. In the
larger class 'Dudu,' 'Torch,' 'Ildegonda,' 'Surge,' 'Aveyron,'
'Sweetheart,' 'Dione,' and 'Nadejda,' gave some good racing, and one
memorable day, when all the above but 'Ildegonda' and 'Torch' sailed a
race in a gale of wind, in company with the yawl 'Dryad,' nearly every
yacht in the race had some mishap to gear, 'Dryad' and 'Dione' being
dismasted.</p>

<p>From 1875 to 1880 the racing was kept alive by the 10-ton class, the
meeting of the 'Lily,' 'Florence,' 'Merle,' 'Mildred,' 'Chip,'
'Preciosa,' 'Juliet,' 'Elaine,' and 'Robinson' being <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span> looked
forward to with eagerness by the amateur crews. 'Florence' was the pick
of this bunch, but the arrival of the 'Maharanee,' and then of the
celebrated 'Buttercup,' soon altered the state of affairs. 'Buttercup'
swept the board for some time until Mr. W. Cory brought 'Ulidia' into
the club, and she in turn scored off 'Buttercup.' This virtually closed
the 10-ton racing in the Thames.</p>

<p>In 1881 some excitement was caused by the starting of the 3-ton class on
the Thames, and as no paid hands were allowed in these little vessels,
the Corinthians were in request in club matches. The 'Muriel' was
brought over from Ireland by the Messrs. Fox, and had for competitors
the 'Maramah,' 'Mascotte,' 'Naida,' 'Primrose,' 'Venilia,' and 'Snarley
Yow,' of which the latter was probably the fastest. The excitement
culminated in a race for a 50<i>l.</i> cup, subscribed for by several
enthusiastic members, and sailed for under the auspices of the
Corinthian Yachting Club on June 13, 1882, 'Muriel' winning the cup
after a splendid finish with 'Snarley Yow.' The next year saw the advent
of 'Chittywee,' who spread-eagled the old fleet, and was in turn knocked
out by the redoubtable 'Currytush.' This killed the 3-ton class in the
Thames, and for some time class racing was at a discount. The Corinthian
Yacht Club, however, by arranging a system of handicaps and other races
to suit the vessels belonging to the club, nearly always succeeded in
getting good entries for its matches, an annual handicap race from Erith
to Ramsgate, open to all yachts in the club, being still one of the most
popular events of the season.</p>

<p>The 20-rating class has not been patronised for some time in the Thames,
but 'Decima,' 'Fan Tan,' 'Dis,' and 'Corona' have had some good racing
between 1890 and 1892 in the 10-rating matches. The entries in the
numerous handicap matches have included the above four yachts and such
vessels as 'Gardenia,' 'Neaira,' 'Terpsichore,' 'Norman,' 'Mimosa,'
'Wenonah,' 'Cyclone,' 'Ildegonda,' '&OElig;nanthe,' 'Nadejda,' 'Alpha
Beta.'</p>

</div>

<p>In 1888 an attempt was made by the club to encourage a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> class
of small cruising yachts by limiting the length and sail-area, and seven
or eight were built from the designs of Messrs. G. L. Watson, Fife,
Dixon Kemp, J. T. Howard, Douglas Stone, A. E. Payne, A. Watkins, and
others. This class, known as the Thames 21-foot class, has since then
furnished extremely close racing, and it is worthy of note that the
first boat built, the 'Tottie,' designed by Mr. Watson, successfully
held her own for five seasons. The season of 1892, however, showed that
the 'Eva,' designed and built by Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span> Stone, of Erith, was
quite as good as, if not better than, 'Tottie,' her new owner, Mr.
Wyllie, sailing her in first-class form. Much of the 'Tottie's' success
must be put down to her extremely skilful handling by the brothers
Simpson, who rank among the best amateurs of the day. While the 21-foot
class has undoubtedly been a most popular one in the Thames, it is
unfortunately the fact that the original idea of encouraging a good
useful cruising boat was not fulfilled, the ingenuity of the designers
being too much for the few restrictions imposed. We believe that three
of the original boats which were not so successful in racing are now
being used as cruisers, but the faster or deep-keeled boats are hardly
of the type that would be chosen for this purpose.</p>

<p>The names of the 21-footers are 'Tottie,' 'Eva,' 'Diskos,' 'Haze,'

<p>During the last two or three years prizes have been offered for
2&frac12;-raters, but the class has not as yet taken any hold on the Thames
men, the only entries having been 'Camilla' and 'Cock-a-whoop.' This
club now offers a challenge cup for 1-raters, viz. the cup won by the
3-ton 'Muriel,' and presented to the club by Captain H. C. Fox.</p>

<p>The Club received the Admiralty warrant to fly the Blue Ensign in 1884,
and in 1893 Her Majesty the Queen was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> graciously pleased to
command that the club should be called the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club.</p>

<p>The present officers of the club are: Robert Hewett, Esq., Commodore,
and Rear-Commodore of Royal Thames, and of 'Buttercup' celebrity; J.
Weston Clayton, Esq., Vice-Commodore; Frank C. Capel, Esq.,
Rear-Commodore; H. Neville Custance, Esq., Hon. Treasurer; and T. G. F.
Winser, Esq., Secretary.</p>

<p>In order to extend the usefulness of the club to its members, the
committee last year secured a club-room at Burnham on the Crouch, a most
charming piece of water for small craft. With the greatly improved state
of the Thames at Erith, however, it is probable that most of the yachts
will come back to the headquarters of the club as of old. It is many
years since fish were caught at Erith, but of late they have returned,
and the Thames is now in as good condition as could be desired. This
river and its estuary form a perfect cruising ground for the amateur
yachtsman, and with a snug anchorage and comfortable quarters at the end
of a cruise, such as the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club affords, he must be
a glutton who is not satisfied.</p>

<p>The number of yachts belonging to the club is 220, ranging from 1 to 500
tons.</p>

<h3>ROYAL LONDON YACHT CLUB</h3>

<p>The Royal London was established in 1838, and takes the lead in the
Victorian period. It began its career in May 1838 as the Arundel Yacht
Club, when the majority of the yachts were probably kept on the
foreshore at the foot of Arundel Street, Strand. Its flag at that time
was a red field, white border, and white letters.</p>

<p>In 1845 the name was changed to the London Yacht Club, and the flag
adopted was a white field with a blue cross, the union in the upper
corner, a gold star in the lower. In 1846 the star was changed for the
City arms, on receipt of a grant <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> of this privilege from the
Corporation of the City of London. 1849 was an important year in its
history. The club received the patronage of Queen Adelaide, whereby it
became Royal (a privilege not so easily obtained in those days), and
also the recognition of the Admiralty by which the possession of an
Admiralty warrant was secured to its members.</p>

<p>In early days the races were sailed above bridge, with an occasional
bold venture as far down the river as Erith or Gravesend; but, finding
by experience that no serious dangers existed in such then comparatively
unknown waters, the above-bridge races were in a few years abandoned,
and the time-honoured course from Erith round the Nore and back adopted.
After many years, owing to the increase in the size of the yachts, and
in both the number and size of the vessels navigating the Thames,
another change was made. The Royal London always showed energy where
yachting progress was concerned, and was the first to adopt flying
starts on the Thames. A small class raced thus May 14, 1878, and it may
be noted that the club was one of the first clubs in the United Kingdom,
if not actually the first, to adopt the Y.R.A. rules, October 20, 1892.
The office of Admiral was filled by the election of H.R.H. the Duke of
York to that post. A striking illustration, not only of the progress of
the club, but also of the development of yachting, is shown in the
following table:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>On the social side its advance has been equally striking. After
wandering about for many years, in 1857 rooms were engaged at the
Caledonian Hotel, Adelphi. In 1882 the prosperity of the club justified
the opening of a branch club-house at Cowes, and three years later the
London headquarters were moved to their present position in Savile Row.
These changes were attended by the most satisfactory results. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> numbers, instead of fluctuating between 200 and 300 as they had
done for a series of years, at once began to increase, and now there are
over 700 names on the books. The yachts have increased correspondingly.</p>

<h3>THE LONDON SAILING CLUB, HAMMERSMITH</h3>

<p>The London Sailing Club is a vigorous and practical association which
has to be specially commended for two features lately introduced. The
first of these was an exhibition in its rooms of 1-rater half-models,
scale 1 inch to the foot, each to carry a centre-plate&mdash;the design to
show shear plan, body plan, and half-breadth plan. Each design was
accompanied by a sealed envelope containing the designer's name. These
envelopes were not opened until after the designs and models had been
judged, and the prizes, three in number, awarded by Mr. Dixon Kemp. The
whole arrangements were most satisfactorily carried out. The exhibition
opened February 21, 1893, the models remaining on view until March 6.
These models, from the hands of professionals as well as amateurs, were
in some cases very beautiful. The first prize was awarded to Mr. David
Weir, of Partick. The second ran Mr. Weir very close indeed, and when
the envelope was opened the name of J. M. Soper was discovered, a name
associated with many leading Solent small raters. The awarding of prizes
is always a responsibility, but with Mr. Dixon Kemp's experience and
scientific knowledge he had little difficulty.</p>

<p>The second feature referred to was the reading of papers by leading
authorities on practical subjects connected with construction and
sailing. The first paper, on centreboards, was read by Mr. Dixon Kemp,
and illustrated with diagrams on the blackboard, and a discussion opened
by Mr. Warrington Baden-Powell, of canoe fame, followed. The reading of
these papers has a good influence in bringing members and their friends
together. For special subjects experts and specialists are invited, and
much valuable information is often afforded. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>(p. 181)</span> About it as a club
there is nothing very particular to be said. It is popular with its
members, and very successfully carries out the objects of the
foundation.</p>

<h3>THE UPPER THAMES SAILING CLUBS</h3>

<a id="img095" name="img095"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img095.jpg" width="400" height="253" alt="" title="">
<p>Upper Thames Sailing Club and Club-house, Bourne End,
Bucks, 1893.</p>
</div>

<p>In the year 1893 the Queen graciously extended her patronage to the
small raters, now so much in vogue, inland and on the coast, by
presenting a 50-guinea Challenge Cup, to be annually sailed for by the
Upper Thames Sailing Clubs during the Bourne End week, when the Upper
Thames Club hold their fresh-water festival opposite the club-house
which was constructed in 1889 at Bourne End, Bucks. The spot is well
selected, and affords a commanding view of the long clear reach in which
the matches are sailed over a course of nine miles. The Duke of
Connaught is their President, the commodore, Colonel FitzRoy Clayton, a
practical enthusiast of great experience, one day thrashing a 1-rater
through bad weather inland, and the day after perhaps hauling on to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>(p. 182)</span> mainsheet of one of our big racers out in the open, equally
enjoying both. The secretary is most practical and does much to assist
the club with his large fleet of divers kind, from Norwegian punt and
American sneakie built by himself, to his steam launch 'Leopard.' He has
yet another craft of considerable interest, a Dutch yacht, a perfect
marvel of the Hollander's handicraft and beauty of finish; she was built
in Friesland about 1830, and is as sound now as when first launched. The
Challenge Cup, which is in the form of a bold flagon, pilgrim bottle
shape, height 17 in., weight 99 oz., was first sailed for at Bourne End
on Jubilee Day, June 21, 1893, by the following clubs, Thames, Thames
Valley, Upper Thames, Tamesis, Thames United, and Oxford University. The
morning of the 21st was bright with a strong sailing breeze. The race
was set for 1.30, and soon after noon all the crews were carefully
overhauling their gear and studying the barometer. The weather suggested
then having to reef down at the last minute. It must be remembered that
the river is not wide at Bourne <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span> End, and that it was a flying
start. Ten boats were under weigh, all trying and man&oelig;uvring for
position, and yet all was done without a foul or a protest; the handling
was admirable, it was really a sight to see. A little water might have
been shipped, but that was soon baled out, and the curious acrobatic
performances of the shifting ballast, stretching out to windward, was
also a prominent feature.</p>

<a id="img096" name="img096"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img096.jpg" width="400" height="271" alt="" title="">
<p>Upper Thames steam yacht 'Cintra.'</p>
</div>

<p>The 'Challenge,' 1.1-rater, O.U.S.C., led at first for three or four
rounds, 'Mona,' .85, close up, 'Mirage,' 1.0, going well and looking
very handsome. At the finish there was capital racing. In the last round
but one 'Mona,' .85, leading, caught a hard gust and took in a reef in a
very workmanlike way to make sure of saving her mast. It was admirably
done and elicited great praise, as she came in running neck and neck
with 'Challenge,' 1.1-rater, both on different gybes, 'Challenge' with
her little spinnaker on the port hand and 'Mona,' .85, on the starboard.
The spinnaker must be the same size as the jibs in these races. The
secretary had handed over his steam launch 'Leopard' to Captain Bell of
the Thames Conservancy, whilst he and the commodore sailed the 'Kitten,'
which came in fourth. The six-day festival of the six Thames Sailing
Clubs, so happily and pleasantly blended, promises well for small-rater
sport in the future.</p>

<h3>THE ROYAL WINDERMERE YACHT CLUB</h3>

<p>The beautiful Lake district is provided with an excellent yacht club,
well organised, with workmanlike system and detail; and, as a
fresh-water club, it is here described after the Thames associations. It
was founded in 1860 and possesses a Royal Warrant dated 1887. The
headquarters are at Bowness, adjoining the Old England Hotel, and
consist of club-house, reading-rooms, billiard and committee room, and
boat landings; and the club has a very hospitable arrangement, like the
Bombay Club, by which gentlemen not residing within ten miles of
Bowness, on being proposed and seconded by two members, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span> can be
admitted as temporary members, for a week, fortnight, or month, for a
moderate fee. The sailing committee request owners to see that
professional crews of yachts engaged in races wear white or blue
jerseys, yachting or man-of-war caps, or straw hats. The ensign is red
with crown in fly.</p>

<p>The leading feature of the Royal Windermere Lake Yacht Club is well
shown in the illustration on p. 185, as, out of comparatively few
members, fourteen are at the starting line, a proportion very seldom met
with in any club, and certainly suggesting great unanimity and good
feeling. The beautiful surroundings of the lake constitute a great
charm, though crews in racing craft have not much time to admire
picturesque landscape.</p>

<p>The Windermere Club takes precautions to ensure as much as possible
real, well-contested races, and like the 'Water Wags' at Dublin has
definite club measurements, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Length of yacht on load-water-line, from fore side of stern to
after side of rudder post, shall not exceed 20 ft., and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span> the
total length from fore side of stern to extreme end of counter shall not
exceed 25 ft. 6 in., and no part of stern above or below water shall or
sternpost below water shall project beyond the 20-ft. gauge. A yacht
shall be considered to be on her load-line when she lies adrift from her
moorings in smooth water, without crew, with all sails set and racing
gear on board.</p>

<p>As will be seen by the chart, Bowness is situated about a little north
of the half length of the Lake. The Ben Holme flag boat opposite, at the
north end, is the Waterhead flag buoy, and at the south end of the lake
is the Town Head buoy.</p>

<p>The club course is from the ferry round a flag buoy off Town Head at the
south extremity of the Lake and back to the Ben Holme flag boat,
opposite Bowness. The distance is 18 miles.</p>

<p>The Waterhead course is from Waterhead, N. extremity of the Lake, round
flag buoy, off Ben Holme (Bowness), thence round flag buoy in Lowood
Bay, thence round flag buoy in Pull Wyke Bay, thence round Waterhead
flag buoy, sailing the same course again and turning off Waterhead. The
natural formation of the surrounding district explains the special
necessity for the two life buoys ready for immediate use, as squalls and
stormy weather are characteristics of the Lake district, although the
regattas are sailed in the finest season, during the month of July. The
secretary, Lieut.-Col. Arthur L. Reade, has courteously furnished
details of this interesting inland club. The photographs of the

<span class="smaller">YACHTING ON THE NORFOLK BROADS</span><br>
<span class="smcap">By G. Christopher Davies</span></h2>

<p>The sailing of small yachts and boats is vigorously indulged in upon the
rivers and lakes of Norfolk and Suffolk, in what is popularly known as
the Broad District. There is, indeed, every temptation to the sport in
this favoured region. No <i lang="fr">mal de mer</i> can haunt its smooth waters; there
is no tossing about in exposed anchorages, but instead the mooring by
grassy banks odorous with flowers. Gales lose their terrors and zephyrs
gain additional charm on these placid and sinuous waterways and toy
lakes. Yet there is room enough and to spare for all the evolutions the
boat-sailer delights in, and the exploring cruises dear to the owners of
small yachts, while life on sailing houseboats is sufficiently tempting
to the laziest lotus-eater. The adventurous can make adventure, the
explorer can lose himself in mazy reed-beds, the lounger can lounge with
the minimum of trouble, the young can picnic in the most luxurious
fashion, ladies can 'yacht' in the most ladylike way, and complexions
will not pale (what is so piteous as a seasick woman?) upon these
favoured streams. Even the sturdiest sea cruiser acknowledges the charm
of the quiet gliding between their verdant banks, and the quiet sleep
dependent upon neither watch nor riding light. No one enjoys a sail at
sea in fair summer weather more than I do; but upon the many occasions
upon which the sea has been rougher than I approved of, I have said in
my haste: 'What a fool I must be to desert the safety and surety
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> of the Broads for this, which is neither safe nor sure!' At the
same time it is only fair to say that, after a quick and pleasant
passage to some foreign port, I have also said: 'Better one such sail
than many on the Broads.' My boating life has been spent in a
vacillation between the quiet pleasures of the Broads and the excitement
of the sea; and I have made many attempts to procure craft in which to
enjoy either at will. This is a difficult matter, inasmuch as the
draught necessary for able work at sea is too great for the rivers.</p>

<a id="img104" name="img104"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img104.jpg" width="400" height="445" alt="" title="">
<p>The 'Greyhound.'</p>
</div>

<p>Although many thousands know well the district of the Broads, yet to
the bulk of people it is still a <i lang="la">terra incognita</i>. It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> is
therefore necessary to give at least a brief description of the <i lang="la">locus
in quo</i>. Taking one's stand at Great Yarmouth, with one's back to the
sea and facing inland, one sees&mdash;or could in truth see if one ascended
the lofty Nelson Monument&mdash;first the narrow and busy harbour which
conveys the waters of all the rivers to the sea, then a great tidal lake
known as Breydon Water, four or five miles long. From this one can
ascend by vessel the greater river Yare, which for twenty miles of broad
and sinuous course threads the marshes to Norwich. On the right is the
Bure, commonly called the North River, which twists and turns for
twenty-seven miles to Wroxham, and is navigable further yet to
Coltishall and Aylsham. Tributary to this river are the Ant and the
Thurne, giving access to the largest of the Broads. Southward of Breydon
is the deep and clear Waveney, with Beccles twenty-three miles from the
sea at Yarmouth, and a short cut to the sea by Oulton Broad and
Lowestoft.</p>

<a id="img105" name="img105"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img105.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="" title="">
<p>The fisher's home, the Broads.</p>
</div>

<p>Broadenings of these waterways at many points have become, by the growth
of reeds and accumulations of soil, lakes or Broads, more or less
separate from the rivers, but in most cases having navigable access to
them. The characteristic of the district is its extreme flatness and
the consequent slight fall of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span> the river-beds, the current being
mainly tidal, with not much difference of level at that. Yet this
flatness is not monotonous; for, in addition to the ever-varying and
ever-pleasing cloudscapes seen to best advantage in flat regions, there
are beauties on the marshes and river borders of no common order. The
luxuriant growth of reeds around the lakes gives the feeling of utter
seclusion from the madding crowd. The gay hues of flowering plants,
altering with sunshine and shadow of clouds on the wind-swept marsh, the
deep shades of groves, the clear and winding rivers, the dark-brown and
high-peaked sails of the wherries with their graceful curve of leach,
and the white sails of the yachts scattered here and there, now
reflected in a glassy reach, and again seeming to thread the verdant
marshes where no water is visible from one's standpoint; the kestrel
hovering over the 'rand,' a jay hunting a reed-bed for nests and eggs,
waterfowl of many kinds, the splash of fish in a quiet bay, a heron by a
lilied dyke, and innumerable noticeable incidents of bird and insect
life, make the hours too short which are spent on these singular
waterways.</p>

<p>In order to fully understand the peculiarities of the craft navigating
the Broads and rivers both for trade and pleasure it is desirable to
appreciate the necessities of the district; and for this purpose it
would be well to step on board some kind of craft on which one can be
independent of hotels as well as railways. For it is quite clear that
journeys by rail cannot show one the life of the Broads. It is singular
what a difference the point of view makes. Thus there are reaches where
the rail and river run near each other. From the rail there is nothing
to see but a flat marsh and a winding river. But from a boat on the
river the view assumes an altogether different aspect. If one pleases,
the tall and swaying reeds, brown topped and feathery, may bound the
scene, hide the rail, and provide one with the loneliness of nought but
water and sky&mdash;a veritable solitude; or from a higher standpoint the eye
may travel with a keen interest over the reed-beds and the
brilliant-hued marsh, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span> past windmill and dwarf tree to the
undulating and wooded higher lands which are the shores of the marsh.</p>

<p>For choice for a mere cruising holiday, I would take, if middle-aged, a
real Norfolk wherry converted into a roomy houseboat as presently to be
described. The Norfolk wherry is a craft quite unlike those of any other
district, and eminently suited to the shallow and somewhat narrow waters
of its birthplace. The limit of suitability seems to have been reached
by perfection, since of late years no alteration whatever has taken
place in the design of the wherry or its sail. As it is the aboriginal
craft, so to say, of these waters, and its graceful sail forms a
constant object of interest upon the waterways, it merits the pride of
place in a description of Norfolk craft. It has greater interest also in
that it is suitable for cruising in other waters, notably in those of
Holland and Friesland, where Mr. Doughty found that a Norfolk wherry was
even more suitable for Dutch waters than the Dutch vessels, so far as
pleasure purposes go.<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23" title="Go to footnote 23"><span class="smaller">[23]</span></a></p>

<p>The draught of an unladen wherry is from 2 ft. 4 in. to 2 ft. 6 in.,
with a beam of 13 ft. and a length of 52 ft. It has a short hollow bow,
with the greatest beam well forward and a fine run aft. It has only a
few inches outside keel, yet in fairly smooth water it lies remarkably
close to the wind, going fast through the water all the time. The mast
is stepped 12 ft. 6 in. from the stem, and is a splendid spar of spruce
fir or pitch pine 37 ft. deck to hounds, without any stay other than a
forestay, and supports a single sail of the following dimensions: luff,
27 ft.; foot, 28 ft.; head, 29 ft.; and leach, 44 ft. 6 in. There is no
boom, and the gaff has a high peak. The sail is hoisted by a single
halliard set up by a winch on the mast. A drawing and lines of a wherry
accompany an article by myself which was published in the 'Field' of
March 20, 1880, to which the reader who may be interested can refer. The
mast swings in a tabernacle, and the heel is weighted with lead and
iron <span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> to the extent of 1&frac12; ton, and is so well balanced that a
boy can lower and raise it. It will be seen that the rig has the extreme
of simplicity to recommend it. One man can sail a 30-ton wherry,
although he generally has the assistance of his wife or a mate. When
within a few yards of a fixed bridge the sail is rapidly lowered, the
forestay tackle cast off and windlass unhitched from the mast, and down
comes the mast as gently as possible; the wherry shoots through the
bridge, and up go mast and sail the other side. The mainsheet works on a
horse on the cabin-top in front of the steersman, and with his back
against the tiller he controls the great craft with ease. The stern is
pointed, and the rudder is no less than 5 ft. in breadth. Of course the
tonnage of the craft varies; the above measurements are those of a
medium-sized one. A cabin about 6 ft. long in front of the small
steering-well accommodates the crew, and there is a long hold, reaching
to the mast and protected by movable hatches, for the cargo.</p>

<p>A few years ago some ingenious person hit upon the idea of converting a
trading wherry into a pleasure one by raising and permanently fixing the
hatches, placing windows at the sides (there is no bulwark, and but a
narrow plankway between the edge and the cabin sides), dividing the
roomy interior into saloon and bedrooms, and so producing a commodious
and comfortable sailing houseboat, which has become exceedingly popular.
There are numbers of them about now, and they are always in demand for
hire by parties visiting the Broads.</p>

<p>The large sail carries a sort of flounce laced on to the bottom of it
called a bonnet, and the removal of this is equivalent to lowering a
topsail. The trading wherries carry no ballast when empty of cargo, but
the pleasure wherries have a sufficient quantity of scrap iron. They
move in the lightest of airs, and in strong winds are marvellously
stiff. They will tack in channels no wider than their own length, but in
narrow waters they are helped round by the man giving the bows a set off
each bank with a 'quant' or long pole (Latin <i lang="la">contus</i>); they are
capable of high speeds, and the easy way in which they get <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span>
about the narrow and shallow waters is surprising. Occasionally they
essay the sea passage from Yarmouth to Lowestoft, instead of going round
by the rivers, and even race at sea; but it cannot be doubted that in
doing so they go beyond the margin of safety. Although Mr. Doughty
successfully towed a wherry behind a steam tug from Yarmouth to
Stavoren, another wherry essaying the same feat was lost. The low, long,
flat hull cannot stand rough water, and the heavy mast with its weighted
heel is a dangerous lever in the wrong position.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img106.jpg" width="400" height="243" alt="" title="">
<p>Regatta time.</p>
</div>

<p>Many yachts have been built after the plan of the wherry, but with
yacht-like hulls above water. At first the simple wherry rig was
retained, but soon there came a boom to the sail, and then a bowsprit
and jib, additions which, no doubt, make the vessel faster, but mean
more help in handling&mdash;two men instead of one, and so on. These barges,
as they are called, have increased greatly in number during the last few
years. The other day I counted no fewer than twelve lying moored on
Oulton Broad, where five years ago one such would have attracted
attention. The immense influx of visitors to the Broads is, of course,
responsible for this increase. The latest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span> of these barges, the
'Waveney,' is no less than 58 ft. long, but it is believed that there is
considerable difficulty in getting her about.</p>

<p>The barge yacht is more seaworthy than the wherry, and one&mdash;the
'Ianthe'&mdash;has twice crossed the North Sea to Holland for cruising in
Dutch waterways. She was fortunately favoured with fine weather, and it
would, no doubt, be needful to make as sure as possible that the weather
was set fair for a day or two before venturing. The draught is but 5 ft.
or less, and the heavy pole mast is set far forward, while there is an
open well, so it would not be the best kind of craft for bad weather.
Still, for modest sails out of the harbour, for Dutch waters, and for
Norfolk rivers, these barges possess every advantage, while they are
most comfortable to live upon.</p>

<p>The barges look smarter than the wherries, inasmuch as they have white
sails instead of brown or black, and yacht-like decks and fittings; but
I must say that for pure river cruising I prefer the plain wherry. It is
more picturesque in appearance, and, size for size, easier to handle,
although, no doubt, the latest types of barges are faster.</p>

<p>Taking one's departure from Wroxham, one finds a narrow river crowded
with boats. Only a few years ago the arrival of a single yacht at
Wroxham was an event. Now both banks of the river are lined with
wharves, yachts, and boats, and boat-builders' sheds are springing up on
every side. A striking tribute to the favour in which the Broads are
held is the boat-letting establishment of Mr. Loynes, who at the first
Fishery Exhibition exhibited models of small open centreboard boats, to
be converted at night into sleeping cabins by most ingeniously contrived
awnings. In consequence of this he desires, and very properly, to divide
with the writer the honour of first drawing the public attention to
these favourite cruising grounds. From the small beginning he then made
he has come to own many yachts, large (20 tons) and small (3 or 4 tons),
mostly built by himself, capable of navigating the shallowest of the
Broads, comfortably fitted with all essentials of comfort, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span>
attended by most civil and capable men. He is now introducing his boats
to the Friesland meres, and it is probable that many of his Norfolk
customers will follow him to that larger lake-land. His vessels are
mostly centreboard and of light draught, the latter, by the way, being
of more vital necessity than ever. The tourist steamers which now rush
up and down the Bure draw down the soft mud from the sides and deposit
it in the channel, so decreasing the depth. A few days before writing
this I had a 25-ton cutter towed up from Yarmouth to Wroxham, for the
purpose of laying up, by a steam-launch. By taking out ballast her
draught was reduced to 5 ft. 6 in., yet she grounded at least twenty
times in the upper reaches, right in the middle of the channel.</p>

<p>Wroxham pleasure craft.</p>
</div>

<p>The river below Wroxham is very narrow and very sinuous; its banks lined
with groves of trees which intercept the wind. The lofty peak of our
wherry's sail holds the air over the bushes, and we keep slowly moving
along, while smaller boats are either becalmed or, catching sudden
puffs, lay over at alarming angles. It is a Saturday evening, and very
many little yachts, from the open lugsail sailing boat on which a
high-roofed cabin-top has been placed to the 4- or 8-ton yachts of
smarter build, are making their way down to more open waters for the
happy and healthy week end, most blessed to the person whose
occupations are sedentary. A mile or two of charming river <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span>
reaches brings us to Wroxham Broad&mdash;a lovely sheet of water surrounded
by an inner circle of tall green and feathery topped reeds and an outer
circle of bushes and trees. It is entered by a narrow gateway from the
river, and boating is freely permitted, subject to certain wise
regulations which are as much to the interest of the public as to that
of the riparian owners.</p>

<p>The reeds have a golden belt where the rise and fall of the water has
left its yellow mark, shining brightly in the westering sun. In the
smooth patches under the lee of the reeds one may see the sparkle of
bait flying out from pursuing pike or perch, and in the still bays the
coots and water-hens dive and splash. Across and across the Broad skim
the white sails of boats and canoes making the most of the dying breeze,
and the wavelets sink to ripples, and the ripples are shot with streaks
and patches of cloud-reflecting calm. We leave this, the most beautiful
and deepest of the Broads, to make the most of the evening air down the
river.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the annual regatta there is a prodigious water frolic
at Wroxham, which is attended by perhaps a hundred sailing craft of all
kinds, and much merriment results.</p>

<p>Gliding quietly down stream we pass on the left Hoveton Broads, Great
and Little&mdash;nurseries of wildfowl and kept strictly private, with chains
across the entrance; on the right Salhouse Broads, Great and Little, on
which boating is permitted under protest; and further still on the right
Woodbastwick Broad, also strictly private. Hoveton little Broad is a
breeding-place of the black-headed gull, which nest here in great
numbers.</p>

<p>So by wood and mere and sighing reed we pass with many a twist and turn
until we reach the hostelry of Horning Ferry. Here, as night draws on,
many vessels arrive. Strolling along the bank we can note what is after
all the great fun of Broad yachting&mdash;the camping and living on board a
floating house, however small. The big wherries and barges are of course
floating houseboats, comparatively luxurious; but at the other extreme
here are three or four open boats covered in with canvas tents or
awnings luminous with the lamps within, and with myriads <span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> of
dazzled night insects pattering against the shining canvas. The evening
meal is being discussed, then there is the clatter of washing-up, the
cleaning of knives by thrusting them into the soft bank, the washing of
plates with tufts of paper, and the general tidying-up which is part of
the fun to young men, but which ceases to possess any charm to older
ones. These rivers are capital places for the man fond of single-handed
sailing. One well-known and elderly amateur sails a lugsail boat alone,
but at a proper distance behind him comes his man in another
single-handed boat. The latter pitches his master's tent and relieves
him of household troubles, and retires to his own boat tent when not
wanted. This is really a capital arrangement.</p>

<p>Wroxham Broad.</p>
</div>

<p>When the stars come out, the herons settle in the shallow pools; the
wild duck fly from the sheltered decoys and preserved sanctuaries to
more open feeding-grounds; a shot rings out on the August night from
some reed-hidden gunner who has been patiently awaiting the evening
flight. In contrast come the notes of a piano and song from a barge;
along the bank is a row of lights from cosy cabins; the inn is thronged
with boat-sailers eagerly discussing their common sport; then the last
cheery good-nights, and silence falls over the lone marsh and winding
river.</p>

<p>In the morning there is the splash of swimmers, blankets and bedding are
put out to air on the cabin-tops, spirit and paraffin stoves mingle
their scent with that of frying bacon and the wild thyme on the banks.
About ten o'clock the little yachts spread their sails to the freshening
breeze, and off they go. If we have ladies on board, they will probably
wish to go to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> Horning Church in the morning, and can then sail
in the afternoon with a clear conscience&mdash;a compromise approved by the
strictest sabbatarian, who finds in the peace and quiet of Norfolk
waters an assurance that neither the wind nor he is a sinner in the
gentle movement.</p>

<p>After lunch the wind has freshened so that we take our bonnet off (off
the sail, that is) and smaller vessels reef. The wind, too, is ahead,
and we have to tack a great deal as we continue our course down stream.
Still the river course is so tortuous that every reach is not a head
one; sometimes, indeed, we can lay one reach on one tack and the next
reach on the other tack. It is pretty to watch the yachts shooting from
side to side of the river (which widens as we proceed); they lay over,
with the water bubbling over the lee deck and the foot of the great
balloon jib deep in the water. The long bowsprit sweeps over the grass
of the margin as the helm is let go; the boat shoots up into the wind,
is upright with fluttering jib for a moment, then off she goes on the
other tack to repeat the man&oelig;uvre at the opposite shore. If the
mainsheet is well handled the mainsail never shakes. As it loses the
wind on one side it catches it on the other, the jib being kept slightly
aback until the boat's head is well off the wind. It is no joke to
handle the jibsheets of an 8- or 10-ton boat. In spite of soft cotton
rope being employed, the chafe will try the horniest hand. In sailing
the jib is worked to every puff, eased off or drawn in at every
variation in direction or strength of wind. The man in charge watches
the wind pressing down the grasses and reeds and darkening the water in
advance, and trims his sheet to every puff or lull. If he does not, why,
the boat is not sailing her best&mdash;that is all. The mainsheet man, too,
is almost as particular. When there are hands enough to work the sheets
no one thinks of making a sheet fast. The bends of the river are too
frequent for that. Again, there is almost always another yacht ahead or
astern, and you strive to overtake the one or sail away from the other,
so that every day's sail is more or less of a race. In passing or
meeting other craft the rules of the road are well <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> observed,
and the steering is usually so excellent that a space of six inches is
considered an ample margin of distance from the other vessel. These
narrow rivers soon develop considerable skill in this direction, and
accidents do not often happen. The least rare is that of misjudging the
rate at which a wherry is coming, and getting athwart her bows while
tacking; but a direct collision is averted, and the yacht's bowsprit or
mainsheet is the only thing which suffers.</p>

<p>On the right we pass Ranworth Broad, a fine lake in two sections, the
larger of which is now in process of being closed to the tourist; on the
left the mouth of the narrow river Ant, which, after twisting like an
eel for some five miles, opens into the navigable but shallow Barton
Broad, of considerable size. There is a bridge over the Ant so narrow
that the larger kind of vessels cannot get through.</p>

<p>The tract of marsh widens out and the view broadens. On our right is a
mile-long channel leading to South Walsham Broad, part of which is
navigable and part private. As an instance of how vibrations of movement
are carried along water, a gentleman residing at South Walsham tells me
that when the water <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> near the staith is covered with a thin
veneer of ice he can tell when a wherry entered the mouth of South
Walsham Dyke from the river, a mile and a half away, by the ice rippling
and cracking.</p>

<p>Passing the ruins of St. Benedict's Abbey on the left, we presently come
to the mouth of the river Thurne, up which we sail for a few miles to
Potter Heigham Bridge, where in company with several barges and yachts
we moor, with the intention of visiting Hickling Broad and Horsey Mere
on the morrow. The night falls dark and lowering, with flashes of summer
lightning in the south lighting up the great distance of flat and
treeless marsh; but no rain falls, and a quiet night and sound sleep
bring us to the dewy morn of another glorious summer day.</p>

<p>Most of the larger yachts and pleasure wherries have centreboard sailing
dinghies, and it is more convenient to take ours through the narrow arch
where the tide-impelled current sweeps upward to diffuse itself over the
terminal lakes, twenty-five miles from the sea by river, three miles by
land. Here, save in the tourist-crowded month of August, may be found
true solitude. The river runs through far-reaching marshes, a branch
leads through a wilderness of water and tall reeds, the brown tops of
the latter trembling against the clouds from our low point of view.
Water, reeds, clouds; a kestrel hovering overhead, our boat gliding on
clear, shallow water over trailing weeds and shoals of startled rudd;
then the wider channel of Heigham Sounds, and at last the expanse of
Hickling Broad. Four hundred acres it is said to be, but the reedy
margins absorb a great part of this. Still, there is water enough to
make the scene imposing, and the first thought of a boating-man is&mdash;What
a splendid place for sailing! But looking down through the clear water
one sees that the bottom is almost within reach of one's arm, and even
in the channels there is only sufficient water for a wherry. It is
obvious, therefore, that the shallow centreboard boat is the only type
fit for Hickling. It maybe useful to mention that a recent judicial
decision gives <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> as the law that the public have the rights of
navigation and passage over Hickling Broad, but that those of fishing
and shooting are vested in the riparian owners.</p>

<p>Not far from Hickling, and connected with it by Heigham Sounds and a
narrow dyke, is Horsey Mere, so near the sea that the sea-water at times
wells into it in the shape of salt springs. At the entrance of the mere
a small cruising yacht is lying, the men having gone ashore for a walk
over the sand dunes to the sea. The mooring rope is fast to a deck scrub
thrust into the bank, and a heifer, having found out the roughness of
the scrub, is leisurely rubbing herself all over and most thoroughly
against the bristles. A wherry sweeping down the dyke with peak lowered
leaves us but scant room to pass as we sail back to Heigham Sounds.</p>

<p>From Potter Heigham we sail in the wherry down the Thurne, into the
Bure, and so on to Acle Bridge, where the mast has to be lowered. From
Acle to Yarmouth the sail is not so interesting. The tide runs strongly
and the banks are shoal. This part of the passage is undertaken of
necessity, and not for pleasure. At Yarmouth we enter Breydon Water,
where the greater space and depth of channel brings us into contact with
larger yachts. Still, it is yachting in miniature, and the man
accustomed to Cowes must think it rather ridiculous of us to call our
small craft yachts. I much prefer the old and truly descriptive term of
pleasure boats. When the Broad sailor comes to Breydon he feels that,
comparatively speaking, he is in the open sea, and a beat across it with
a smart breeze against tide means wet plankways and an exciting sail.</p>

<p>At the top of Breydon to the left is the entrance of the river Waveney,
so shallow and dangerous as to be avoided. The river Yare, to the right,
is wide and deep, and gives good sailing ground up by Reedham to
Cantley, where the chief river regattas are held, and higher still to
Norwich. From Reedham a narrow and straight canal, called Haddiscoe Cut,
leads into the Waveney at a point above its shallows and a fixed
bridge. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> The bridges on the Yare and the Upper Waveney from
Haddiscoe to Beccles are railway bridges, opening save when a red flag
or lamp denotes the arrival of a train. The scenery on both rivers
seaward of Reedham is flat and uninteresting, and it is above Reedham,
on the Yare, and St. Olave's, on the Waveney, that the beauty of the
landscape adds interest to the sailing.</p>

<p>As one proceeds up the Waveney and through the narrow dyke which
connects the Mid-Waveney with Oulton Broad, Lake Lothing, and the sea at
Lowestoft, one meets great numbers of yachts and sailing boats, and we
may now dwell more closely upon the characteristics of these.</p>

<p>The old term in existence before the more ambitious title of yacht was
<em>pleasure boat</em>. This was applied to the decked sailing boats we now
call yachts, and is perpetuated in the sign of the Pleasure-boat Inn,
Hickling. A favourite type, of which but few examples exist, was the
lateener, first, I believe, consisting of two lateen-shaped sails, but
afterwards of a lateen-shaped foresail and a gaff-mizen. The foresail
was set upon a short mast right in the bows and raking well forward, and
the yard was often twice the length of the vessel. Such a rig was very
close-winded, and handy enough to handle once the sail was up; but the
long yard was a great nuisance in raising and lowering the sail, and the
reefing had to be done along the long yard instead of the short boom.
The boats also were dangerous in running before the wind, being apt to
run under head first. This may have been partly owing to the short and
full bow which was deemed necessary to support the weight of the mast
and sail, and which at high speed created a great hollow in the water.
Possibly a lateen-rigged, sharper-bowed boat would even now be found to
be a very fast and handy type for our rivers. The balance lug so much in
vogue is but a lateen sail with the fore-angle cut off. I only know of
two lateeners of late on our waters&mdash;the 'Ariel' of Beccles, a boat of
about 10 tons, and the 'Black Maria' of Barton Broad. The owner of the
latter died recently, and it is possible the yacht is not now <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span>
in commission; but she looked picturesque threading the narrow and
sinuous reaches of the Ant on her way to and from Barton Broad.</p>

<p>River Waveney craft.</p>
</div>

<p>A light-displacement boat is a necessity upon Norfolk waters. It is not
only that the depth is small and that the draught of a boat should not
exceed 4 ft. 6 in. if she is to get about comfortably, but the water
displaced by her movement has but little room to disperse in the
narrower channels. It is sufficient to watch the light-displacement
sailing wherry going fast through the water with scarcely a ripple, and
making but slight difference in the level of the water at the grassy
margins, and then to see a heavy-displacement steam wherry going not so
fast, yet piling up the water in front of her, filling and emptying the
dykes and runlets as she passes, to understand that the one thing
essential for speed is light displacement. Again, in a
heavy-displacement craft of my own which is sometimes brought upon the
rivers, whenever the waterway is constricted she moves slowly and the
river craft gain upon her. When the channel suddenly broadens she seems
to leap forward and away in a striking manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> Many yachts have come to try their speed with the Norfolk
boats, but generally having greater displacement have come off
second-best, although possibly better craft in more open waters. The old
type is a flat-bottomed boat with a deep keel spiked on to it; the angle
between the keel and the hull is filled in with more or less graceful
curves, but the principle is the same in the most successful of the
modern racing yachts, as it was in the older craft: a beamy, flat hull
and a comparatively deep keel. Practically there is no change in the
midship sections other than that which more skilled workmanship and more
artistic design have evolved. The principle is only the same, however,
so far as the midship section is concerned. Great advances, or at all
events alterations, have gradually been made in the longitudinal design
of the boats.</p>

<p>Quick turning has always been a necessity with the yachts of the Broads,
and this has been attained by the help of three peculiarities&mdash;a keel
short for the length of the boat, a rudder so large as to be in reality
a movable keel or leeboard, and an enormous jib, which is the only
head-sail. The size of the jib is also influenced by the fact that it
has to balance the equally enormous mainsail. In order partly to carry
as much sail as is required for these smooth waters the mast is always
well forward, and with a large mainsail and boom projecting far over the
counter great head-sail is a necessity.</p>

<p>The old measurement of racing craft used simply to be length on the
'ram' or keel, which as long as all boats were of the same type in other
respects was fair enough. But a boat, say, 20 ft. over all would have a
counter of 9 ft. or 9 ft. 6 in.; practically half her length would be
counter. I do not think this great counter was altogether the result of
an attempt to cheat the tonnage measurement, although no doubt this may
have had some influence. It was more the result of circumstances; the
yacht with a short keel, well forward, and great rudder, turned more
quickly than a boat of similar size with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> longer keel and
smaller rudder. About half this great counter was permanently immersed,
and when a boat laid over, almost the whole of it came into bearing. It
was popularly supposed that the broad, flat counter peculiar to the old
boats bore the weight of the boom; the yachts, though very quick and
handy, carried tremendous weather helm and were very hard to steer,
sometimes taking the strength of two men to prevent them shooting into
the wind. When the helm is let go, the little vessel shoots so quickly
into the wind that she might be put about on the other tack by backing
the jib, without further touch of the tiller. In fact, so powerful is
the great overhang of mainsail and jib in controlling the balance
pivoted on the short keel that I have many times tacked a 4-ton boat up
a narrow reach without touching the tiller at all, simply by
manipulating the sheets, and this, too, while sailing single-handed.
This was by way of experiment only. The usual way of sailing a 4-ton,
or, for the matter of that, a 10-ton yacht single-handed, is while going
to windward to make the mainsheet fast, steer with your back, and work
the jibsheet with your hands. Reaching or going free you work the
mainsheet and jibsheet alternately as best you can. All the boats have
large open wells, the jibsheets lead aft through a couple of blocks
shackled to the clew of the sail, with the standing part fast to eyes on
each plankway, and leading blocks further aft. Thus there is just
sufficient purchase to enable a strong man to control the jibsheet of a
10-ton boat. In sailing these boats there is no making the jibsheet fast
if you wish to get the best speed out of the vessel. They are trimmed to
an inch, and every bend of the river means a careful and anxious
adjustment of the jibsheet. The same remarks apply to the mainsheet, and
where two or three equally capable amateurs are engaged in sailing there
will be keen differences of opinion as to the proper quantity of sheet
to be allowed out, and hot arguments as to the advisability of an inch
more or less, when to the man accustomed to sailing in more open water
the difference would appear immaterial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span> In tacking, the stern of the boat swings upon the pivot of the
forefoot, and it frequently happens that in sailing close to the bank of
the river before putting about, although the bowsprit bends the grasses,
and the stem is clear of the bank, yet the counter cannons against the
bank or shaves the mud.</p>

<p>Whether it was found that advantage was taken of the keel measurement to
get larger boats by means of immersed counters, or whether it was simply
to give more scope to designers, is a matter of controversy; but it was
ordained that half the length of the counter had to be added to the
length of keel to form the factor of length, the rest of the measurement
being according to the Thames rule. This rule of measurement prevailed
for many years without any particular alteration in the type of boat
supervening. Then, and only recently, length on the load-water-line was
taken, and presently the Y.R.A. rules of measurement and rating were
adopted.</p>

<p>The effect of the alteration has been to lengthen the keel, and perhaps
to round up the forefoot a little. It has been suggested that it would
be as easy to attain the quick turning by rounding the forefoot and
having the greatest draught aft as it is by the present method of
keeping the draught well forward and shortening the keel; but there is
this objection&mdash;the shores next the banks are frequently shoal and
muddy. When the boat swings round on her deep forefoot, if that is free
from mud the lighter draught stern is sure to follow; but when a light
draught forefoot is still free from the mud, the deeper draught stern
swings on to it and is caught, and the boat's head pays off to leeward
before she releases herself. Experience goes to show that in the larger
classes the boat with much drag aft is not suitable for these
shallow-margined rivers, and that to succeed in racing it is necessary
to be able to perform the feat of waltzing a boat round and round in
little more than her own extreme length, as the writer has done by way
of experiment. A boat which will only handle when she has steerage way
does not stand much chance.</p>

<p>'Greyhound,' midship section.</p>
</div>

<p>The yachts used generally to be built by that rule-of-thumb method, the
result of long and slow experience, which has often proved more sure
than the experiments of science; but of late years two boat-builders
have studied intelligently the principles of design, and have applied
them with great success to the building of the most successful craft yet
seen upon these waters. These two are Mr. Brighton of Yarmouth, and Mr.
Mollett of Brundall. The former has confined his attention to the larger
class of craft in use here, and the latter to the smaller vessels. First
of Mr. Brighton's boats to attract attention was the 3-tonner 'Trixie,'
then the 9-tonner 'Wanderer,' and then the 4-tonner 'Greyhound,' all in
their time the best boats of their class, although run hard by those of
other designers. The 'Trixie' is a boat 27 ft. 6 in. over all, 20 ft. 6
in. stem to sternpost, 24 ft. on the water-line, 6 ft. 6 in. beam, and 3
ft. 9 in. draught of water; boom 25 ft., gaff 20 ft., bowsprit outboard
22 ft. She carried about 4 tons of lead ballast. The 'Greyhound' was
designed by William Brighton, but built by workmen of the owner, Mr.
John Hall, of Yarmouth. In design she is undoubtedly the best produced
by Brighton, and therefore the best boat of her size on the rivers.
Proportionately to size, she is a better boat than the 'Wanderer.' Since
she was built, in 1889, she has won 175 first prizes and 30 second, in
addition to several challenge cups, and is also a good little boat at
sea, thinking nothing of making the 'outside' passage direct from
Lowestoft to Dover in fair weather. The design we give is traced from
the moulds off which the yacht was built. The dimensions are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lines of the 'Greyhound,' 1892, Norfolk Broads yacht.</p>
</div>

<p>For river-work she spreads 1,014 sq. ft. sail-area, and her rating is
about 4.5.</p>

<p>The boat is built entirely without caulking, with not a single butt in
deck or hull. The keel is Memel oak; skin of yellow pine 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch;
sawn timbers 2 inches square, with steamed timbers 1&frac12; inch square.
She is in every respect beautifully finished, and some of her success
may be attributable to the excellence of her workmanship.</p>

<p>The designer has refused us any dimensions of the 'Wanderer,' but we
believe that practically she is an enlarged edition of the 'Greyhound.'
She has been run close, if not excelled, by the 'Corona,' a boat
designed for both sea and river, and fairly good on each. She has
greater draught and more rise of floor, with greater displacement. At
first she was fitted with a centreboard, which, however, was found as
useless as it generally is in a boat of comparatively deep draught. Its
province is in shoal boats. I tried a centreboard in the 4-tonner
'Swan,' but discarded it after one season. None of the racing yachts
over 3 tons have centreboards, and experience has shown that on these
waters the centreboard is only of use for the smaller and flatter
boats. It is true that Loynes, the boat-letter, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> has many yachts
up to about 20 tons fitted with centreboards, but then his vessels are
designed to navigate the shallowest Broads, and centreboards are a
necessity in his case. He is, by the way, an adept at fitting
centreboards with various devices to facilitate handling them, and his
cranks and automatic brakes and other mechanical contrivances are most
ingenious and effective.</p>

<p>The 'Corona' was designed and built by Peed of Oulton, who had built
several fast-sailing boats. She is supposed to be a better boat in rough
water than the 'Wanderer,' running her close also in the river reaches
at Cantley, where the regattas are frequently held. She is also a
comfortable cruising boat, having two cabins with good accommodation.

<p>Mr. Mollett's boats have chiefly been of the open and half-decked class.
His first great success was the 'Cigarette,' a centreboard lugsail boat,
which won a great number of prizes and was a perfect witch in going to
windward. He followed this up by several similar boats, all fairly
successful and betraying advances in cleverness of design and
experiments upon well-thought-out principles.</p>

<p>In 1890 Mr. Mollett startled the boating fraternity by producing a kind
of double-hulled boat called the 'Gossip,' which, to use his own words,
is 'curious though fast.' Her deck appearance is that of an oblong raft,
and the section of her hull is that of a flattened <b>W</b>. There is no actual
division between the hulls, but a hollow runs along the middle so that
when the boat is on an even keel the top of the hollow is upon the
water-line. When she heels over the windward hull is raised more or less
out of the water, and the vessel sails on the support of the leeward
portion, the windward portion acting as a kind of outrigger or windward
ballast. The buttock lines are, roughly speaking, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span> segments of a
circle of long radius with only the middle and lower part of the segment
immersed. She had no keel, but a centreboard dropping between the hulls,
and a deep rudder. Her dimensions are: Length over all, 28 ft.; length
on L.W.L., 17&frac12; ft.; beam, 7&frac14; ft.; depth, 2&frac14; ft.; draught of
hull, 10 in.; draught with plate down, 3&frac34; ft.; area of sail in
foresail and lug mainsail, 460 ft.</p>

<a id="img113" name="img113"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img113.jpg" width="400" height="276" alt="" title="">
<p>'Castanet.'</p>
</div>

<p>The 'Gossip' was extremely fast running and when sailed full, and won
several races. Her mode of going to windward looked peculiar, as she was
sailed broad full and rattled from side to side of the river at a rare
pace, so that although neither sailing so close as the other competing
craft nor shooting so far in stays, being so light, yet she would often
make a point to windward quicker than any of them by reason of her
speed; and, after all, as Mollett says, the object is to get to windward
as quickly as possible, no matter how you do it.</p>

<p>The 'Gossip' had, however, one grave defect. She would turn turtle with
astonishing suddenness. Her vanishing point was soon reached. She had to
be sailed with the utmost skill and caution, and it is only by good luck
that she has not yet drowned anyone. The only time I sailed in her,
being <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> unaware of this peculiarity, I as nearly as possible had
her over in a sudden puff; which, as I had my children on board, might
have been a serious matter. Her owner tells me that she has capsized
five times, and has very frequently been on the verge of capsizing.</p>

<p>A design of this remarkable craft, and an interesting article upon her
by Mr. Mollett, appears in the 'Field' of January 10, 1891. Mollett took
the centreboard out and substituted a fixed keel with 5 cwt. of lead on
it, which he was sanguine enough to say rendered the boat practically
uncapsizable. She has, however, capsized several times since then. He
afterwards removed the keel and returned to the centreboard, with which
he thought the boat was faster and handier. Since then a succeeding
owner has reverted to a sort of heavy fin-keel, but the boat has not
done so well in racing as formerly. Her canvas is, however, worn and
stretched, which may have something to do with it. We hope, for the sake
of her owner and his companions, that she will disappear somehow or
another before any fatal accident results from her use.</p>

<p>Noticing how cleanly our flat counters leave the water, Mollett
thought&mdash;What is the use of having a sharp bow to divide the water? Why
not have a double-sterned boat, and let the bow slide over the water
instead of through it? Something of this idea was present in the
building of the 'Gossip,' but in the 'Castanet,' lately built for Mr.
Russell Colman, the idea has had full sway. There is a broad, flat,
spoon bow, differing very slightly on deck from the stern, and not
differing at all on the water-line, so that it is practically immaterial
which end is selected to go first. There are the same segments of large
circles for buttock lines. The load-water-line is 17 ft. 3 in., and on
deck 29 ft., the overhang being very nearly equal at each end. The beam
is 7 ft., and the extreme draught of the short fixed keel, which is
spiked to the bottom of the spoon, is 3 ft. 2 in., with 23 cwt. of lead.
The latter is disposed at the bottom of the keel in a triangular bulb.</p>

<p>If you take an ordinary tablespoon and press it into a soft <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span>
substance at different inclinations, the water-lines which it will mark
are much the same. The principle is the same in the 'Castanet.' The
water-lines lengthen and narrow as she heels over, and the length at
which she is measured when upright is considerably exceeded at both
ends. The spoon comparison is only to a certain extent applicable, as
one end of a spoon is smaller than the other, while in the case of the
'Castanet' both ends are large ends. There is no deadwood except what is
necessary for the keel, and the rudder is a projecting one. Mollett's
theory is that it is better to cut away every inch of deadwood which is
not absolutely necessary for preventing leeway. He finds the boats so
constructed sail faster in every way. As to whether a fin-keel or a
weighted centreboard is the better, he has not yet made up his mind.</p>

<p>Hull of the 'Castanet.'</p>
</div>

<p>The 'Castanet,' although beaten in her first race by the 'Gladys,' a
boat of conventional design, has subsequently proved herself the fastest
of her class. When sailing fast she lifts herself out of the water
forward and slides very easily over it, although her flat bow makes a
noisy brabble of the surface <span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span> water, which is, however, not
detrimental to her speed. Of course she would not do in rough water, but
in smooth she is stiff, fast, and remarkably handy. In spite of her
square ends, which are but little narrower than the rest of the boat,
she is, owing to excellence of workmanship, rather a handsome boat than
otherwise. It is not likely that another 'Gossip' will be built, but the
'Castanet' is a taking precedent which may be followed up with
advantage.</p>

<p>There are other designers and builders of fast boats, which have,
however, nothing peculiar in build or rig to justify especial notice.
They are simply well-designed boats of light displacement and large
sail-area, very fast and very handy.</p>

<p>There are two boating clubs in existence which provide regattas for the
encouragement of sailing. The senior and more select club is the Norfolk
and Suffolk Yacht Club, which professedly holds races for the 9-and
10-tonners&mdash;the 'large yachts' of the Norfolk rivers. It has a
club-house at Lowestoft which is a great convenience to yachtsmen using
the harbour, but as a river club it has not much vitality. The junior
club is the Yare Sailing Club, which welcomes all amateurs as members
who can pay a 5<i>s.</i> subscription. It professedly encourages the sailing
of open and half-decked boats, and the smaller class of yachts of 4 tons
or thereabouts. It has a large number of members, most of them keen
boat-sailers, and its regattas are well attended and the races
numerously and keenly contested.</p>

<p>The classes in the Norfolk and Suffolk Club are: Not exceeding 2-rating,
exceeding 2 and under 5-rating, and exceeding 5-rating; and those in the
Yare Sailing Club as follows:&mdash;Class I.&mdash;Exceeding 2-rating and not
exceeding 5-rating. Class II.&mdash;Exceeding 1-rating and not exceeding
2-rating. Class III.&mdash;Not exceeding 1-rating. Any 'foreign' boats (all
persons not natives of Norfolk are foreigners) which can sail in these
classes are welcome, and any wrinkle they can teach will be quickly
taken up.</p>

<p>The 'Mystery,' a Thames open boat, is almost the only <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span> strange
boat which has succeeded in showing the way to the local racers, and I
think she would not be second to either 'Castanet' or 'Gladys.' It would
be most interesting to see a match between the well-known Thames 'Ruby'
and our Y.S.C. boats. Regattas are held at various points on the river,
and there are, in addition, local regattas unconnected with clubs.</p>

<p>'Mystery,' Thames boat ('foreign' boat).</p>
</div>

<p>Once a year there is what is called an Ocean Match&mdash;that is, a match
from Lowestoft to Harwich&mdash;on the Saturday before the regatta of the
Royal Harwich Yacht Club. This is looked upon as a great adventure by
the river boats, which tackle the sea under the cloud of canvas which is
enough on the rivers. The trip to Harwich and back, and the excitement
of bringing up in wide water, after the safety of a grassy margin,
furnish food for many tales for the rest of the year. The <em>crux</em> of the
thing is the passage round the bleak Orfordness, where the tidal race
raises a cruel sea if there is any wind; the great mainsails with their
long booms cannot easily be reefed under way.</p>

<p>One necessary rule upon these rivers sometimes causes trouble to
strangers who are unaware of it. In the narrow reaches it is almost
impossible to pass a boat to leeward, so if <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>(p. 219)</span> the overtaking boat
can but get a few inches of her bowsprit overlapping to windward of the
slower boat, the latter must give way and let the other pass to windward
of her.</p>

<p>Visitors often get nervous when they see a wherry bearing down upon
them, but there is no occasion for them to do so. If the boat-sailer
observes the rule of the road, he may be sure that the wherryman will do
so. The latter are a very civil and obliging class of men, taking a keen
interest in the doings of smaller craft and yachts. It is usual,
however, for the yachtsman to remember that he is on pleasure bent and
the wherryman on business, and he therefore gives way sometimes when not
compelled to do so, to save the wherryman from having to put his craft
about. In return the wherryman will often, when tacking, keep his craft
shooting in stays to let a yacht beat past him. The wherries are so long
and take up so much of the river when beating to windward that it is
often very difficult to pass them at all unless they make this
concession. The rowing boats which are hired by inexperienced people in
great numbers at Oulton Broad are great sources of danger. The occupants
generally go the wrong side of a sailing boat, and it is a wonder that
accidents do not more often occur. Another source of difficulty are the
anglers, who are very fond of mooring off the windward bank (where there
is a quiet 'lee') well out in the channel, and perhaps at a 'scant'
corner&mdash;that is, where the next reach being to windward the sailing
vessels hug the corner as closely as possible in order to get a good
shoot into the next reach and so save a tack. It does not do, however,
to hug the corner too closely, as if it is at all shallow the way of the
boat is deadened, though she may not actually touch the mud. The
'putty,' as the black soft mud of the river bottom is locally termed,
plays an important part in sailing on Norfolk rivers. It serves
sometimes to help a vessel to windward. Thus a wherry might not be able
to hug the weather shore or to lay close enough to sail along the middle
of a reach, but if she drops to the leeward shore the pressure of water
between her bows and the mud will 'shoulder' her off and stop her
leeway, so that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> she can drag round a corner and save a tack.
Some of the wherrymen will say that they could not put their craft
aground if they would while sailing sideways along the mud. The
deeper-draught yachts do not reap this advantage to any extent.</p>

<p>One of the things which make a yachtsman ask if life is worth living is
to run hard on the putty. He gets out his quants and shoves; but the
poles sink deep into the mud, and require more force to withdraw them
than to drive them in. Those who know the river best seem to me to get
oftenest aground, because they cut it too fine, and if their
calculations are out by an inch or two they stick fast. The desperate
struggles to get free are more amusing to other people than to the chief
actors in the scene. How blessed is the sight under such circumstances
of a friendly steam-launch! I remember well one heart-breaking
experience of my own in a 4-ton yacht which I was sailing single-handed.
I got aground in the Bure at Yarmouth in the awful place known as the
North End, and with a falling tide. I got off at last, after exerting
myself until my heart beat frantically, my mouth was parched, and my
eyes dim; then seizing a bottle I supposed to contain beer, I tossed
half a tumblerful down my throat ere I found it was <em>vinegar</em>!</p>

<p>A good half of Oulton Broad is taken up by yachts lying at their
moorings, which are buoys at a sufficient distance apart to give the
boats room to swing. There appears to be some doubt as to what authority
has the right to interfere, and so nothing is done; but a better plan
would be to have proper mooring-places along the shore where yachts
might moor in tier, a small charge being made for the privilege.</p>

<p>Below Oulton Broad is Lake Lothing, a tidal lake communicating with
Lowestoft Harbour. A lock gives access to it. Lowestoft Harbour is a
most convenient one, easily entered at all states of the tide. A large
basin is reserved for the use of yachts during the summer months, and
from its easy facilities for a day's sail at sea or a run up the Broads
in the dinghy or steam-launch it is yearly becoming more popular with
yachtsmen.</p>

<p>Leaving Oulton Broad and re-entering the Waveney, we find <span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span> deep
water right up to Beccles, which some sea-going trading vessels use as
their port; but in the upper reaches the river is very narrow. It is,
however, extremely pretty. Almost the last of the lateeners&mdash;the old
'Ariel'&mdash;hails from Beccles.</p>

<p>On every Whit Monday there are great goings-on at Oulton. There is for
one thing a regatta, and the Broad is literally crowded with boats; and
for another it is the smacksman's yearly holiday, and he is very much in
evidence both ashore and afloat. It is, however, but fair to say that
the disgraceful scenes of drunkenness and fighting which formerly
characterised Whit Monday are not so marked. The smacks' crews are now
so well looked after by mission-ships afloat and Salvation Armies ashore
that a most gratifying improvement has taken place in their manners and
customs.</p>

<a id="img116" name="img116"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img116.jpg" width="400" height="180" alt="" title="">
<p>A start.</p>
</div>

<p>On a Sunday morning it is interesting to stroll round by the fish
wharves in Lowestoft and listen to the outdoor services and services on
smacks, and note the intense earnestness animating the rough-looking
seamen who are the speakers, and the respect with which they are
listened to even by well-known rowdies.</p>

<p>We leave Oulton Broad in company with several barges, and it is a race
between us to get to Cantley, on the Yare, in time for a regatta of the
Yare Sailing Club. Our wherry is gradually left behind by all the
barges, but they have to wait at Herringfleet Bridge on account of a
train, and as we come up just as the bridge <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span> is opened we are
again on even terms with them, and are third out of six as the
procession files along the narrow Haddiscoe Cut. At Reedham we meet the
contingent of trading wherries which have started from Yarmouth with the
flood, and several yachts on their way to Cantley, so that as we pass
the picturesque village of Reedham and turn to windward up the broad
reaches of the Yare the scene is a very animated one. At Cantley it is
difficult to find a mooring-place, and the northward bank is lined with
yachts for half a mile.</p>

<p>After the regatta we can sail up a most interesting part of the river,
by the pretty ferries of Buckenham, Coldham Hall, and Surlingham,
exploring Rockland and Surlingham Broads in the dinghy, and so on up to
Norwich, just below which city the riverside scenery is most beautiful.</p>

<p>The rapidly increasing popularity of the Broads has given a great
impetus to the trade of boat-letting, and the agencies are too numerous
to mention. It may be useful, however, to say that, just as Loynes has
made Wroxham a well-known starting point, so Bullen, of Oulton Broad,
has done the same by the latter water. He owns or has the command of a
large number of yachts and barges, some of which are suitable for
Holland. At Norwich Messrs. Hart &amp; Son, of Thorpe, have a similar
agency, and the fishing-tackle makers and secretaries of yacht and
sailing clubs keep lists of yachts to let. An advertisement in the
'Eastern Daily Press' will elicit replies. Also, if any reader of this
article chooses to write to me at Norwich, stating what kind of craft he
wants, <em>and enclosing a stamp</em>, I will forward the letter to a suitable
yacht agent. I will not, however, undertake to reply to any letter,
because in one or two of my boys' books I promised to do so, and the
consequence is I get a recurring crop of letters from boys in many parts
of the world, which are excessively inconvenient to a busy man, although
it would be unkind not to reply to them.</p>

<p>To sum up, the rivers of Norfolk and Suffolk, with Oulton, Wroxham,
Barton, and Hickling Broads, are most excellent cruising grounds for
small yachts and sailing boats; and as for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> racing, I really
think that 'foreign' boats, if their owners would remember that light
displacement and a gigantic spread of canvas are essentials, would have
an excellent chance of lowering the pride of the local men. The power of
quick turning is, of course, a <i lang="la">sine quâ non</i>.</p>

<a id="img117" name="img117"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img117.jpg" width="400" height="196" alt="" title="">
<p>In the gloaming.</p>
</div>

<p>Practically the chief interest of the Broads to visitors lies in their
cruising advantages rather than the yacht racing to be obtained or seen;
and it may serve a useful purpose to go more into detail as to the
nature and cost of the craft to be hired for cruising, and to give
itineraries of short cruises. While yachts can be hired at Norwich,
Wroxham, Yarmouth, and Oulton Broad, the business is more scientifically
carried on at Wroxham and Oulton than elsewhere, and the convenience of
visitors more thoroughly consulted by the persons already named as
catering for the public there. The class of craft is also rather
different. At Oulton there are for comfort the usual barges and
wherries, and for fast sailing the usual four to ten tonners of the
smart type already described. At Wroxham a fleet has been built
consisting of vessels chiefly designed for ease of handling and comfort
of camping and cruising, without any pretensions to racing speed. They
are also of shallower draught than the Oulton boats, and have as a rule
centreboards instead of the deep fixed keels of the others. It is,
therefore, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span> a matter of individual taste, and further
comparisons would be invidious and perhaps unjust. With the deeper
yachts it is customary to explore the shallower Broads in the jolly,
while the smaller centreboards can be taken there. Those who chiefly
love the science of sailing will prefer one sort, and those who delight
most in exploring every lilied pool and in camping will prefer the
other.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate, perhaps, to have to mention names in a book not
intended to advertise persons whom it will probably survive, and it may
seem unjust to other meritorious traders in the same line; but in the
interest of the reader it has to be admitted that Bullen of Oulton and
Loynes of Wroxham have taken too prominent a part in the exploration of
the Broads for us to shirk mentioning them, any more than we can avoid
naming the chief builders and designers.</p>

<p>None of Loynes' craft draw more than 3 ft. 6 in., and they range from
twenty-three tons downwards. The largest will sleep four ladies and four
gentlemen. The cost of hire is from 10<i>l.</i> to 12<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per week,
according to the season, the height of the season being July and August.
The hire includes two men, who are boarded by the hirers. This boarding
of the men is rather a nuisance, but it is so much the custom that
attempts to make the men board themselves, paying them increased wages,
do not answer on the rivers. The 4-ton boats will sleep three, and the
hire per week with attendant is 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, and without an attendant
3<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> All household necessaries are supplied, and visitors need
only bring rugs, towels, and provisions.</p>

<p>At Oulton, Bullen has a number of craft, ranging from a large pleasure
wherry accommodating twelve persons, and let at 12<i>l.</i> per week, to the
typical 10- and 5-tonners. He has also several of the barge yachts, now
so fashionable. One of them, the 'Ianthe,' has been twice to Holland,
crossing the North Sea with safety, notwithstanding the shallow draught
and large sail, with heavy mast set well forward. Bullen says that, for
gentlemen who wish to get plenty of sailing, his 10-tonners are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span> the best, but for ladies who require comfort and real pleasure
the barge yachts or wherries are preferable.</p>

<p>A fortnight is required to do all the rivers and Broads properly,
although much may be done in a week if the winds and weather are
favourable.</p>

<p>With only a week to spare, it would be best to stick to the North river,
or Bure. Thus, if starting from Oulton, Norwich, or Yarmouth, sail
straight away to Wroxham, say two days' journey; on the third day back
to Horning and up the coast to Barton Broad; fourth and fifth days up
the Thurne to Potter Heigham, and do Hickling and Horsey Mere; sixth and
seventh back to the starting point. Much depends, however, whether the
object of the cruise is to loiter about and fish, or to sail and cover
the ground. In the latter case the following is an itinerary I have
carried out in a week.</p>

<a id="img118" name="img118"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img118.jpg" width="400" height="175" alt="" title="">
<p>Birds of a feather.</p>
</div>

<p>Starting from Wroxham, Yarmouth can be reached the first day; second day
up the Yare to Norwich; third day Norwich to Oulton Broad; fourth day up
the Waveney to Beccles; fifth day Beccles to Yarmouth; sixth day
Yarmouth to Potter Heigham; seventh day do Hickling Broad in the
morning, and sail up to Wroxham in the evening. A dead calm, or a
combination of head wind and adverse tide, might, however, upset the
plan by a day. It would be well, therefore, to stipulate in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>(p. 226)</span> the
hire that the yacht might be left short of its destination, to be taken
back by the man.</p>

<p>Most people will take fishing tackle with them on a cruise on the
Broads, but I hope everybody will leave their guns at home. The
incessant popping away with shot-guns and pea-rifles is quite useless in
results, very annoying to riparian owners, and very dangerous to the
public. A camera is a much better weapon. Few districts offer better or
more artistic subjects for the photographer's skill. A dark room is
provided upon some of the pleasure wherries, and the tripod is almost
as common an object on the marshes as the windmills.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="smaller">YACHTING IN AMERICA</span><br>
<span class="smcap">By Lewis Herreshoff</span></h2>

<p>The degree of leisure and wealth, so essential to the development of
yachting, was not realised by the citizens of the American seaboard
until nearly one-third of this century had passed, and even then only a
mere handful of nautically inclined sportsmen could spare time from the
stern duties of country settling and fortune-hunting to follow in any
measure their tastes in seeking pleasure on the alluring waters that
flowed at their very feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span> It must not be supposed, however, that our ancestors took
absolutely no pleasure in sailing; they had their pirogues and other
small craft which were kept ostensibly for trade, but which served the
double purpose of affording gain and pleasure.</p>

<p>In the traditions of my ancestry I learn of a small boat kept by one who
used her to visit an island farm, whence he brought produce; and another
would sail down the bay (Narragansett) for the love of it, but largely
to meet and pilot up the tortuous channel his returning vessels from
their coastwise trade.</p>

<p>No people were ever more advantageously situated for yachting, as to
frequency of harbours and tempting conditions of water and weather, than
are the dwellers on the eastern seaboard of North America. True that the
season for yachting is from May to November only in the more northerly
portions (north of Hampton Roads); but if a genuine yachtsman takes in
five months of his beloved sport, it will be found that the remaining
seven will be none too long to talk over the exploits of the past
season, and prepare and plan for the coming.</p>

<a id="img120" name="img120"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img120.jpg" width="120" height="271" alt="" title="">
<p>R.Y.S. Cup,<br> won by the<br> 'America,' 1851.</p>
</div>

<p>As the character of water and weather that surround a locality has a
direct bearing and influence on the form and rig of yacht, it is thought
that a short sketch of the coast and its surrounding waters will be of
interest.</p>

<p>The shores of Maine, as well as those of the British Provinces, present
one of the most interesting fields for yachting that can be found in the
whole continent of North America.</p>

<p>The deeply indented coastline and numerous outlying <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span> islands
afford endless variety in scenery as well as in the surface of the
water. Choice may be had between sheltered bays and the open sea.</p>

<p>The atmosphere during the first half of the yachting season is somewhat
obscured by fogs, but after July the air is clear and bracing, with
pleasant breezes from the sea during the day, and land winds during the
night from north-west. Tidal currents are swift and the change of level
is large, particularly on the shores of the provinces, ranging from 10
ft. or 12 ft. at Portland to far more as one sails eastward, whilst in
the Bay of Fundy the rise and fall often reach 50 ft. Moving southerly,
good yachting ground will be found from Cape Anne to Cape Cod; the
waters thus included are fairly smooth in summer with harbours available
every few miles, the shores being fully occupied by summer resorts where
the visitors are, as a rule, yacht-owners, or deeply interested in
aquatic sports. In fact, this locality, embracing Massachusetts and Cape
Cod Bays, with their many inlets and harbours (the chief being Boston
Harbour), is the scene of more yacht racing and boat racing than any
other sheet of water in America, as evidence of which some of the open
regattas often start no fewer than 130 yachts and boats varying from 15
ft. to 50 ft. in length.</p>

<p>The winds off the coast of Massachusetts are moderate, twelve to fifteen
miles an hour, easterly in the early part of the season, and south-west
during the summer, with north-west in the autumn. Tidal currents are
moderately strong, with range of level from 6 ft. to 10 ft., fogs are
infrequent and short in duration. After rounding Cape Cod, Nantucket
Sound is entered, a large semi-enclosed sheet of water full of sand
shoals, amongst which the tide rushes to and fro with great speed, and
whilst it is always traversed by yachts and trading vessels, it cannot
be said to be strictly a favourable yachting ground, although sail-boats
of shoal draught may be seen sailing for pleasure or fishing, which
pastimes are enjoyed by the visitors that flock to the island of
Nantucket and the adjacent mainland during the summer season. Fogs are
very dense and frequent during <span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span> nearly, the whole of the
yachting season; the winds are more fresh than in Massachusetts Bay, and
usually are from south to south-west, except in autumn when north or
north-west may be expected.</p>

<p>From the foregoing we sail directly into Martha's Vineyard Sound, where
strong winds and tidal currents are found, with fewer obstructions in
way of shoals than in Nantucket Sound.</p>

<p>On the right of Martha's Vineyard Sound lie the Elizabeth Islands, some
of which are picturesque. The nearest one to the mainland at Wood's
Holl, called Naushon, is owned by several of the Forbes family, who for
many years have been&mdash;and still are&mdash;most interested and intelligent
patrons of yachting; and in one of the most beautiful little harbours on
the north side of Naushon may be seen their fleet of yachts, lying at
the safest of anchorages, often a dozen, some sailing vessels, and
others steam.</p>

<p>Through many of the passages between the Elizabeth Islands access may be
had to Buzzard's Bay, whose shores are everywhere dotted with the houses
of summer dwellers, singly and in small villages; so it goes without
saying that yachting; or more correctly boating, is the chief pastime,
and no more agreeable field can be found for it, save perhaps the
adjoining Bay of Narragansett, which without doubt is the paradise of
yachtsmen.</p>

<p>The winds of Buzzard's Bay are fresh, even strong, and seeing that its
expanse is unbroken by islands, it is often rough&mdash;perhaps too rough for
pleasure-sailing in boats of the size usually seen; but in Narragansett
Bay, though the winds are fresh its waters are not so rough, as its many
islands prevent in a great measure the formation of waves uncomfortably
large. Here, as in Buzzard's Bay, the tidal currents are moderate and
change of level from 4 ft. to 6 ft.; fogs are less frequent than in
Buzzard's Bay, and are never long in duration.</p>

<p>In the ocean, directly south from the mouth of Narragansett Bay, lies
the most favoured spot on the entire coast for yacht racing, and for
the last forty-five years it has been the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span> scene of the most
interesting races held away from the racing grounds at the approach to
New York Bay; but for the best results of racing no place on the coast
is equal to it, its winds are fresh and constant, its tidal currents are
moderate and regular in their time and direction, so that little
advantage can be had by one familiar with the locality over those who
are not.</p>

<p>Few 'flukey' days can be remembered off Newport, and year after year the
races there are becoming more and more important, as the waters in New
York Harbour and its approaches become crowded, and as yachtsmen seek
more open water than exists in the vicinity of New York. Twenty miles
west of Narragansett Bay, Long Island Sound is entered; it is a glorious
expanse of water, more than one hundred miles long and having an average
width of fifteen miles; it is a thoroughfare for an enormous traffic,
and in the season yachting and boating are most successfully and
agreeably followed. Its tidal currents are generally moderate; in a few
places they are swift; fogs are infrequent.</p>

<p>South of Long Island, and protected from the sea by a narrow spit of
sand, are several shallow bays on which boating is largely followed;
proximity to New York makes this shore sought for as a summer resort,
and as boating is the only thing to be done in way of pastime, it is
small wonder that so many boats are to be seen.</p>

<p>The harbour of New York with its approaches, and surrounding waters of
the East and Hudson Rivers, are all splendid ground for sailing; but,
seeing that traffic has so taken possession of nearly every available
spot, yachting is forced into the more distant waters of the lower bay,
and those parts of the Hudson less frequented by trading vessels. That
part of the sea east and south of the Sandy Hook Lightship is a famous
racing ground, and is destined to become even more so as competing
yachts find the crowded waters of even the lower bay unsuitable for a
just comparison of the speed of their vessels. The sea-coast of New
Jersey, like that of Long Island, has many inlets <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span> leading to
sheltered, shallow bays, where may be seen numberless small yachts and
sail-boats from 40 ft. in length downward to the most unpretentious
cat-boat.</p>

<p>Delaware Bay and River are well adapted for yachting, but few large
yachts are to be seen there, the dwellers in that section being content
with boats and small sloop yachts.</p>

<p>Chesapeake Bay is a noble stretch of water that is almost unknown to the
yachtsman. Its advantages are many, and in the near future it is to be
hoped that the inhabitants along its shores will avail themselves of so
fortunate an opportunity for sailing with more agreeable conditions than
exist anywhere south of New York Bay.</p>

<p>Fogs are rare and tidal currents slight, except when induced by a
constant high wind either up or down the bay; the rise and fall also
from purely tidal causes are very small.</p>

<p>Hampton Roads and tributary waters are all well adapted for yachting and
boating, but all their reputation as a yachting centre has yet to be
made. For boats or small yachts there exists an inland watercourse
through the Canal of the Dismal Swamp from Hampton Roads to the chain of
sounds that skirt the sea-coast of the Carolinas, the waters of which
are for the most part shallow, but well suited for small sailing craft,
and more particularly for small steam yachts drawing less than 6 ft. of
water. Albemarle, the most southerly of these sounds, is broad and deep,
and well adapted for the navigation of yachts of the largest tonnage.
Access to the ocean may be had at Hatteras Inlet, or still farther south
for smaller vessels at Morehead City, where the navigator must take to
the open sea if he would continue his voyage still farther to the south.
More than 200 miles of open ocean must be passed before Charleston,
South Carolina, is reached, which port is well suited for small yachts
and sail-boats, many of both classes being already in use as purely
pleasure craft. Southward from Charleston is good ground for sail-boats
and small steam yachts, numerous islands forming protected channels
through which one may pass as far south as Savannah in Georgia. At
Brunswick, in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span> the same state, is a bay with a large area of
protected water formed by the shelter of islands in which yachts of
modest size thrive, but apart from convenience for shooting and fishing
little use is made of any craft unless by the more venturesome tourists
from the Northern States.</p>

<p>Florida is more the home of the steam yacht than of the sailing craft;
you may ascend St. John's River for a distance of 260 miles in a steam
yacht; at a few places where this beautiful stream swells into a lake
boating may be pursued with no small degree of satisfaction. In the Bay
of St. Augustine one finds many small yachts and a very agreeable place
to sail them, a yacht club, and many evidences of civilisation in the
way of opportunities for sport and pleasure-seeking.</p>

<p>There is also in Florida an extended system of inland navigation, which
at present is but partly developed; soon, however, the entire length
from north to south may be traversed in a vessel of moderate draught. Of
course steam-yachting in such situations is by far the most
satisfactory. The Gulf Coast in general does not present a very
favourable field for yachting except under steam; in summer it is too
hot, and in winter the winds are not steady nor well suited to the taste
of the average yachtsman.</p>

<p>There is a deal of semi-protected water along the shores of Mississippi
and Louisiana, and also some at widely separated bays in Texas, so that,
with a few exceptions, yachting has not been established; at New
Orleans, however, there is a yacht club that has for its field some of
the large inland lakes where yachts of moderate size can be used with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Pacific coast is not well designed for yachting on account of the
extreme infrequency of harbours, and the generally rough sea found off
the coast from Puget's Sound as far south as Point Conception. Puget's
Sound is said to be a most favourable place for all marine sports,
fishing and shooting as well as yachting; it is surely large enough, and
also there is no lack of depth of water, but some time must elapse
before the dwellers along its shores will find sufficient time and
money <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> to indulge in any pastime. The Bay of San Francisco is
well adapted for yachting with vessels of moderate size, the winds are
mostly from seaward and are strong, even more so in summer than in
winter. There is a yacht club in San Francisco with a large membership
and a goodly number of yachts, but most of their sailing is done inside.
The scarcity of coal, and consequent large cost, seems to hinder the
introduction of steam yachts, but a large number of naphtha launches are
used with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>South of Point Conception the conditions are far more favourable for
yachting than in the north; but the want of good harbours, well
distributed, will always serve as a block to the sport. It is true that,
owing to the wonderfully quiet waters, a shelter is not essential, for a
gale of dangerous force is a rarity from a direction that would render
anchorage unsafe; but it is the unceasing swell of the ocean that
renders landing difficult, and makes felt the absence of a harbour over
at least two-thirds of the coast from Santa Barbara to San Diego.</p>

<p>Santa Barbara channel is a charming expanse of water which in summer is
admirably calculated to afford great pleasure to the lover of yachting.
Fogs are rare, winds steady and moderate in force from S.S.W.; but in
winter there is such an entire absence of wind that sailing is wholly
impracticable.</p>

<p>On the islands that form the southerly limit of Santa Barbara channel
may be found several pretty harbours with most interesting surroundings
in scenery, as well as fine fishing and shooting. Forty miles eastward
of the Santa Barbara Islands lies the beautiful island of Santa
Katalina, where there is a fine harbour for small yachts; and as this
island is somewhat removed from the influences of the ocean it may
become, in the near future, a favourite centre for all aquatic sports.
San Pedro, the port of Los Angeles, has what passes for a harbour, in
which may be seen a few yachts and smaller pleasure craft, the embryo
squadron of the Los Angeles Yacht Club. San Diego boasts of the finest
harbour in South California, and, taken in connection with the
neighbouring islands, it is truly a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>(p. 235)</span> very attractive spot for
yachting, which, as yet, has not made much advancement; but by the
recent organisation of a yacht club it is hoped that the sport will
become well established, and afford pleasure to the many tourists who
flock to that blessed climate, where sun and air invite one to spend
one's days in comfort and in love with all nature. It will be years,
however, before yachting on the Pacific coast will have reached anything
like the proportion that it has assumed in the east.</p>

<p>It will be easily seen that the Atlantic coast of the United States and
British Provinces offers the greatest facilities for both boating and
yachting. In almost every situation there can be found large areas of
sheltered and semi-sheltered water specially suitable for small yachts
and boats; and it is at once seen that all these expanses of protected
water are easily accessible from the open ocean, where those disposed
and properly provided may find as large a range of sailing or cruising
as their fancy or means will admit. The very favourable distribution of
wind, the infrequency of fogs, and the rarity of storms during the
yachting season, all combine to make the conditions for general yachting
as advantageous as possible&mdash;in fact, nothing more perfect could be
found even if we search the world over.</p>

<p>From June 1 to the middle of September only one storm of any importance
may be expected; it is from the north-east, lasting two days, and occurs
about August 20. About the middle of September a gale from the
south-east is expected, but it is short in duration, not over eight
hours, and if other storms come from the east or north-east, they are
always foretold two or more days in advance by the Weather Bureau,
prompt notice of them being published in every daily paper in the
section threatened; north-east, east, north-west storms are always
heralded by the same office; the south-east storms are the only ones
that come unforetold. Thunderstorms and sudden squalls are becoming more
and more infrequent on the northern and middle Atlantic coast. It is
thought that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span> settling of the country, with its network of
railways and telephonic wires, exerts a dispersing influence on all
local electrical storms; but, be that as it may, they are now little
felt where once they were of almost daily occurrence in the height of
summer.</p>

<p>The generally quiet character of the water available for yachting, and
the prevailing pleasant weather with moderate winds, combined to
influence the form and rig of boats and yachts in use for the first half
of this century, and if one carefully examines the situation, it will be
found that the style of pleasure craft chiefly in vogue was well adapted
to the requirements of the then yachtsman; but as years passed, new
influences were at work and new requirements sought for, so that to-day
the build and rig of boats and yachts used by our ancestry seem likely
to disappear, save perhaps in certain localities where the shoal draught
must be considered, as along the south shore of Long Island, the coast
of New Jersey, and in much of the waters of the Southern States.</p>

<p>In illustration of the effect that winds and waters have on the form and
rig of yachts, one need only compare the yachts in England with those in
America. The conditions of weather and sea are as different in the two
countries as are their vessels; but it must also be admitted that the
rules of time allowance arranged to equalise yachts of different size in
racing has also had large influence in separating so widely the form of
yachts in the two countries, a difference which, under the newest order
of rules and intercourse, is rapidly disappearing.</p>

<p>The history of yachting in America begins with the brilliant career of
the Stevens brothers, notably the elder of the three, John C., whose
life and labour seem to have been devoted to the development of the best
type of vessel for pleasure. He may justly be called the father of
yachting. The Stevenses lived in Hoboken, and in the early years of this
century to cross the Hudson to New York by the established ferry boat
was slow and uncertain, so naturally the Stevens brothers had each his
own boat, and crossed the river by his own skill, either by sail
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span> or oar. Through ferrying themselves over the river, they became
very skilful in the management of boats, and the love and talent thus
awakened were held by them all their lives.</p>

<p>The first craft of any importance owned by John C. Stevens was 'Diver,'
built in 1809, but of her there exists no record, save the fact of her
being 20 ft. long. He built 'Trouble,' in 1816; she was a pirogue, a
style of vessel much in vogue in those days, 56 ft. long, two masts, one
in the extreme bow, the other a little aft of amidships, with no
bowsprit or jib. Her mid-section is here shown; she was wide and flat,
with a round, full bow, and was said to be very fast for that class of
craft; she has the honour of being the first yacht in America, and
without doubt was a comfortable seaworthy vessel, but was soon put aside
by her progressive master, who in the following fifteen years built and
owned several craft of various sizes and rig.</p>

<p>'Trouble,' midship section.</p>
</div>

<p>It seems to have been a passion of Mr. Stevens to experiment. Indeed,
this striving for something better was the key-note of his life, and a
boon to yachting, since the science of naval architecture made very
rapid progress during his career; for he died having carried the form of
vessels from their rude model in early times to the vastly improved
'Maria,' which famous yacht stands as a monument to his skill and
determination to improve.</p>

<p>One of the fancies of Mr. Stevens was a catamaran, or a boat with two
hulls. She was built in 1820 and named 'Double Trouble.' The sides of
the hulls toward the centre were parallel. But the old 'Trouble' beat
her easily, and she was laid aside to make room for something new and
better. In 1832 Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> Stevens built the schooner 'Wave'; she was
65 ft. water-line and proved to be fast. She visited Boston in 1835 and
1836, and beat all yachts she found there.</p>

<a id="img122" name="img122"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img122.jpg" width="400" height="189" alt="" title="">
<p>'Maria,' sloop, 1846, midship section.</p>
</div>

<p>'Wave' was sold to the United States Government in 1838, and used in the
Revenue Marine Service. Her section is here given.</p>

<p>About this same date other yachts began to appear. The schooner 'Dream'
was built in New York by Webb &amp; Allen; her length was 47 ft. over all,
and she was a well-known yacht, until 1855, when she was lost near
Bridgeport, Connecticut. The schooner 'Sylph' was built in Boston in
1833 by Wetmore &amp; Holbrook, for John P. Cushing, and finally sold to R.
B. Forbes. After he sold 'Wave,' Mr. Stevens brought out 'Onkahya,' a
schooner, in 1839; her tonnage was 250, length on water-line 91 ft.</p>

<a id="img123" name="img123"></a>
<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>'Onkahya' was a departure from other craft in many <span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span> respects,
some of which may be seen in her mid-section here shown. Her keel was of
iron, which gave her unusual stability, and her bow was long and fine to
a degree. She was but a moderate success as a racer, but was a very good
cruiser, having made a voyage to the West Indies. She was sold to the
United States Government in 1843.</p>

<p>After five years' service under the Revenue Marine flag, 'Onkahya' was
lost on the Caicos Reefs, West Indies.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens next appeared on board 'Gimcrack,' a schooner built in June,
1844, by William Capes, of Hoboken, and designed by George Steers. She
was about 51 ft. extreme length, and 49 ft. on water-line, 13 ft. 6 in.
beam, 5 ft. 2 in. deep, and drew 7&frac12; ft. of water. Her chief
peculiarity was a sort of fixed centreboard of heavy plate-iron&mdash;in
short, like the fin-keel of to-day, only without being loaded with lead
at the lower edge. This fin was 4 ft. wide, and 12 ft. or 15 ft. long.</p>

<a id="img124" name="img124"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img124.jpg" width="250" height="189" alt="" title="">
<p>'Onkahya,' midship section.</p>
</div>

<p>'Gimcrack' was not wholly satisfactory to her owner, but served for
three years; several years later she was broken up at Oyster Bay, Long
Island. No model or drawings of her now exist.</p>

<p>The little cabin of 'Gimcrack' has the honour of being the birthplace of
the New York Yacht Club, an organisation that has done vastly more than
anything else to foster a love of yachting, and to promote progress in
naval architecture. On its roll is entered the name of every noted
yachtsman in America, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> and every important yacht has at one time
or another been the property of one or more of its members. The story of
the formation of the New York Yacht Club is best told by reading the
minutes of the first important meeting, and as it has such a direct
bearing on the progress of yachting, it is here given in full:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="center">MINUTES OF THE NEW YORK YACHT CLUB</p>

     <p>On board of the 'Gimcrack,' off the Battery (New York
     Harbour), July 30, 1844, 5.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

     <p>According to previous notice, the following gentlemen
     assembled for the purpose of organising a Yacht Club, viz.:
     John C. Stevens, Hamilton Wilkes, William Edgar, John C.
     Jay, George L. Schuyler, Louis A. Depaw, George B. Rollins,
     James M. Waterbury, James Rogers, and on motion it was
     resolved to form a Yacht Club. On motion it was resolved
     that the title of the club be The New York Yacht Club. On
     motion it was resolved that the gentlemen present be the
     original members of the club. On motion it was resolved that
     John C. Stevens be the Commodore of the club. On motion it
     was resolved that a committee of five be appointed by the
     Commodore to report rules and regulations for the government
     of the club. The following gentlemen were appointed, viz.:
     John C. Stevens, George L. Schuyler, John C. Jay, Hamilton
     Wilkes, and Captain Rogers. On motion it was resolved that
     the club make a cruise to Newport, Rhode Island, under
     command of the Commodore. The following yachts were
     represented at this meeting, viz.: 'Gimcrack,' John C.
     Stevens; 'Spray,' Hamilton Wilkes; 'Cygnet,' William Edgar;
     'La Coquille,' John C. Jay; 'Dream,' George L. Schuyler;
     'Mist,' Louis A. Depaw; 'Minna,' George B. Rollins; 'Adda,'
     Captain Rogers. After appointing Friday, August 2, at 9
     <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, the time for sailing on the cruise, the meeting
     adjourned.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John C. Jay</span>, Recording Secretary.</p>

<p>The New York Yacht Club soon showed vitality, energy, and power, as the
following reports of the first matches will clearly show what amateur
and Corinthian crews could do in those days. 'None but members to sail
and handle their yachts' was the rule, and Commodore Stevens's big sloop
'Maria,' a winner in 1848, was 160 tons.</p>

occasion was reduced to 45 seconds per ton Custom House measurement.</p>

<p>The course was from a stake boat (the 'Gimcrack') anchored off the Club
House, Elysian Fields; thence to and around a stake boat anchored off
Fort Washington Point; thence to and around a stake boat anchored in the
Narrows (off Fort Hamilton), turning it from the eastward and return to
the place of starting. Whole distance 40 miles.</p>

<p>By a resolution passed at the second general meeting, July 13, 1847, it
was decided by members, not yacht-owners, that on the second Tuesday in
October, a regatta should take place for a prize made by their
subscription, the yachts to be manned and sailed exclusively by members,
allowing each boat 'yacht' a pilot.</p>

<p>The following gentlemen were appointed a committee to regulate the
regatta, with full power to postpone if the weather should prove

(<i>From Photograph sent by J. V. S. Oddie.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span> The formation of the New York Yacht Club was followed by a
rapid augmentation of the yachting fleet, and general interest seemed to
be suddenly awakened in the sport. The attention of designers and
builders became centred on pleasure craft, so that in the first five
years of the life of the club several new builders and designers came
into public notice. Foremost among them was George Steers, who showed
marked ability in designing; indeed, it is not too much to say that his
ideas in naval architecture and construction were a guide in the art for
many years. Some of his best known yachts of this period were 'La
Coquille,' schooner, 1842, length 44 ft. 6 in.; 'Cygnet,' schooner, 53
ft. 2 in., 1844; 'Cornelia,' schooner, 1847, length over all 74 ft.;
'Gimcrack,' before mentioned.</p>

<p>In 1846 Winde &amp; Clinckard, of New York, built 'Coquette,' schooner,
length 66 ft.; she made the passage from Boston to New York in 29 hrs.,
and returned in 28 hrs. 'Brenda,' schooner, was turned out by the same
builders in 1845; she was 48 ft. over all. She visited Bermuda in May
1849, and on the 14th of that month sailed there a match with 'Pearl,'
beating her 55 secs., this being the first international race found in
any American record.</p>

<p>The schooner 'Spray,' was built by Brown &amp; Bell, of New York, in 1844;
her length was 49 ft. 8 in. over all.</p>

<p>Commodore Stevens contented himself with 'Gimcrack' for three years,
during which time he was evidently accumulating strength for a great
stroke in yachting, which in the autumn of 1847 culminated in his last
and by far the most famous yacht, the sloop 'Maria,' the largest
pleasure craft of her class ever built in this or any country. George
Steers assisted the Commodore in designing, and during the winter of
1847 and 1848 she was built by William Capes in Hoboken. Sloop 'Maria'
was originally 92 ft. long on water-line, she had the full round
entrance and gradually tapering after body, a style popularly known as
the 'cod head and mackerel tail,' a form that prevailed generally in
all vessels up to about <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span> this date. After two years Commodore
Stevens became tired of the full round bow of 'Maria,' and in 1850 she
was lengthened forward, so that she became 110 ft. on water-line, and
116 ft. on deck.</p>

<p>'Maria' was such a departure from accepted rules, and became so well
known in all yachting circles, that a full description of her is deemed
worthy of record in these pages.</p>

<p>Her beam was 26 ft. 6 in., 8 ft. 3 in. depth of hold, 5 ft. 2 in.,
draught of water at stern, and 8 in. forward. She had two centreboards,
a small one near the stern to aid in steering, and the large board 24
ft. long in the usual position; this main board was of iron and lead,
weighing over seven tons. When first launched 'Maria's' centreboard was
not pivoted, but worked in a vertical line, both ends being dropped to
the same depth.</p>

<p>The great weight of this board was partly balanced by two large spiral
springs, one at either end, which were extended when the board was
lowered. Length of mast 92 ft., 2 ft. 8 in. in diameter at deck, and 1
ft. 11 in. at hounds; it was a hollow spar, being bored out, for the
first 20 ft. having a hole 12 in. in diameter; for the next 20 ft. 10
in., and above that the bore was 7 in. Her main boom was 95 ft. long, 2
ft. 7 in. in diameter and 2 ft. 4 in. at the slings; it was built up
with staves like a barrel, inside it was a system of truss-work with
long tension-rods reaching nearly to the ends. Length of main gaff 61
ft., with a diameter of 2 ft. 2 in. Her bowsprit had an extreme length
of 38 ft., with a diameter of 2 ft.; it entered the hull of the yacht
below deck, leaving the deck space above all free and clear; there was
also a jibboom which materially lengthened the bowsprit, so that the
point where the jib-stay was attached was 70 ft. from the mast. Area of
mainsail, 5,790 sq. ft.; the cloths of this were placed parallel to the
boom, the bighting running fore and aft instead of vertically as usual.
It was thought by the Commodore and his brothers Robert and Edward, who
were equally interested with him in the ownership of the yacht, that a
sail thus constructed offered less <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span> opposition to the passage
of wind than a sail made in the usual style; but the plan was open to
objections, so that it never became popular. Her jib presented 2,100 ft.
of surface, leach 69 ft.; its foot, 70 ft.; foot of mainsail, 94 ft.;
hoist, 66 ft.; head, 60 ft.; and leach, 110 ft. 'Maria' had a working
topsail, but it was rarely set.</p>

TEST RACE, NEW YORK, 1850.</span><br>
<i>132 tons.</i> <i>Built 1848.</i> (<i>Commodore Stevens, N.Y.Y.C.</i>)<br>
(<i>Contributed by E. A. Stevens, of Hoboken, U.S.A.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Commodore Stevens with his famous craft took part in many races and
matches during the first six years of 'Maria's' life; she usually beat
all her competitors, the few failures she suffered being attributable to
the failure of one or other of some new devices in her rigging or
fittings; for her owners were for ever trying something new in way of
experiment.</p>

<p>At one time the ballast of 'Maria' was disposed in a layer on the
outside of her planking, the lead being about 2 in. thick at the rabbit
and tapering to a half-inch about half-way out to the turn of the bilge.
'Maria' had several test matches with the schooner 'America,' just
before that vessel departed on her eventful voyage to England in 1851;
'Maria' usually beat the schooner easily, particularly in smooth sea and
moderate wind. It is related of 'Maria' that on one day when conditions
favoured her she sailed three times completely around 'America' in a
comparatively short distance, which performance forms the subject of a
spirited picture here given.</p>

<p>After the death of Commodore Stevens, and when 'Maria' was the property
of his brother Edward, the yacht was lengthened about 6 ft. or 7 ft.,
and finally rigged as a schooner. She was then sold and used in the
fruit trade, making voyages to the coast of Honduras; but in October
1870, as she was bound to New York with a load of cocoa-nuts, a storm
overtook her when in the vicinity of Hatteras, in which she succumbed,
and vessel and crew were never more heard of.</p>

<p>James Waterbury was also a prominent yachtsman in those early days. The
sloop 'Una' was built for him in 1847 by George Steers, 64 ft. long,
lengthened in 1851 to 68 ft., and again in 1854 to 71 ft. 9 in.;
tonnage, 70. The sloop 'Julia' was built <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> for Mr. Waterbury in
1854 by George Steers, and designed by Nelson Spratt; her length was 78
ft. 8 in. extreme, and 70 ft. on water-line. This wonderful vessel seems
to have sprung into existence by chance; her designer was a quiet,
obscure man, whose ideas of naval architecture appear to have been far
in advance of his time.</p>

<p>'America,' 170 tons, 1851 (Commodore Stevens, N.Y.Y.C.)</p>
</div>

<p>'Julia' was one of the handsomest yachts of her day, and the fastest
when proper allowance for difference of size was made. It is true that
'Maria' nearly always beat her, but in those days the system of
allowance favoured the larger vessel, which error exists in allowance
tables in use at present. The sloop 'Rebecca' was built in 1855 by
William Tooker, a brother-in-law of George Steers, for J. G. van Pelt.
Her length over all was 72 ft., 65 ft. on water-line, 19 ft. 2 in. beam,
5 ft. 8 in. deep, 6 ft. 3 in. draught, 3297.62 sq. ft. of sail spread,
tonnage 77.6. The schooner 'America,' the most famous yacht of her day,
was built by George Steers and W. H. Brown, designed and superintended
by George Steers, launched May 3, 1851, for John C. Stevens, Hamilton
Wilkes, George L. Schuyler, James Hamilton, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span> J. Beekman Finlay,
and Edward A. Stevens, brother of Commodore Stevens.</p>

<p>The 'America' was 94 ft. long on deck, 83 ft. water-line, 22 ft. 6 in.
beam, 9 ft. 3 in. depth of hold, 11 ft. 6 in. draught; her mainmast was
81 ft. long, 76 ft. 6 in. foremast, her main topmast was 33 ft. 6 in.
long, no foretopmast, 58 ft. main boom, no fore boom, 28 ft. main gaff,
24 ft. fore gaff, 17 ft. bowsprit outboard, 170 tonnage. After 'America'
finished her brilliant career in England in August 1851, she was sold
there to Lord De Blaquiere and remained in foreign waters for ten years;
she then fell into the hands of the Southern Confederacy, and when the
U.S.S. 'Ottawa' visited Florida in 1862 'America' was found sunk in St.
John's River. She was raised, pumped out, and sent to Port Royal, thence
to Annapolis, Maryland, where she remained in Government service for
several years, and was finally sold to General B. F. Butler. She still
remains in yachting service as staunch as ever, and by no means the
least handsome nor slowest of the national pleasure fleet; in fact, she
is to day a monument to the skill of her designer and excellent
thoroughness of her builder.</p>

<p>The racing of the 'America' in England 42 years ago has without doubt
had more influence, directly and indirectly, on the yachting world than
the performance of any other yacht, and both countries concerned owe to
her designer and owners a debt of gratitude that will remain uncancelled
for generations; for it has been the means of bringing the two yachting
nations together in many friendly contests, resulting not only in marked
modifications in the form and rig of the yachts of both countries, but
the social intercourse begun so many years ago has continued and
increased greatly to the benefit of yachting, and has led to a more
complete union of all interested in the promotion of close international
relations.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1845 Robert and Isaac Fish (brothers) established themselves in New
York as builders and designers of yachts and other vessels. On the death
of Isaac, 'Bob Fish' continued the business and turned out many
well-known yachts, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span> sloops at first and later schooners. His
yachts were generally successful as racers, and next to Steers his
designs were thought to be best; but whilst his yachts were fast and
usually successful in other respects, their form was not destined to
live, for the system of shoal draught and wide beam is now obsolete,
except in waters where the conditions require special features. Fish
showed no tendency to change the model then in vogue, his last yacht
being just like the earlier in form and in general proportions.</p>

<p>Mr. Fish had great skill in 'tuning up' a yacht for racing, and many
craft owe their success to his ability.</p>

<p>A few of the best-known yachts by Mr. Fish were, sloop 'Newburg,' 1845;
sloop 'Undine,' sloop 'Gertrude,' 1852; 'Victoria,' 1856&mdash;this last
became a blockade-runner in 1863, was captured, sold, and afterwards
wrecked. Sloop 'Eva,' 1866, afterwards a schooner, was capsized and lost
on Charleston Bar. 'Meteor,' schooner, 1869, a large and fine vessel,
was lost the same year on Cape Bonne, whilst cruising in the
Mediterranean. Schooners 'Wanderer' and 'Enchantress' were both very
successful vessels, and fast in their day. In 1869 Mr. Fish remodelled
'Sappho,' giving her wholly new lines and changing essentially her
proportions, vastly improving the sailing qualities of the yacht, as was
afterward proved by her successes in foreign waters as a racer. Another
designer and builder of about this period was D. D. Mallory, of Noank,
Connecticut; he brought out many fast and otherwise successful sloops,
but it can be said of him, as of Robert Fish, that his tendencies in
designing were not in a direction toward improvement; the same wide,
flat, shoal-draught vessels were adhered to from first to last.</p>

<p>Some of Mallory's best-known yachts were 'Mystic,' 1856, 'Richmond,'
1857, 'Mallory,' 1858, 'Haswell,' 1858, 'Plover,' 1859, 'Zouave,' 1861.
In 1864 the Herreshoffs began yacht building and designing in Bristol,
Rhode Island. They had inherited tendencies toward everything connected
with marine affairs, and having been born and bred on the shore of
Narragansett Bay, their attention was early turned to boating, and
later to yachting. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> From the outset the Herreshoffs departed
from old forms, and struck out for something better than the
'skimming-dish,' as the popular model was truly but irreverently called.
Some of the best known yachts built in Bristol were 'Kelpie,' 1864, 'Qui
Vive,' 1864, 'Clytie,' 1865, 'Sadie,' 1867, 'Orion,' 1870, the schooners
'Ianthe,' 'Triton,' 'Faustine,' and a great number of smaller craft of
either sloop or cat rig.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img130.jpg" width="400" height="321" alt="" title="">
<p>'Shadow,' 1872.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1872 Mr. N. G. Herreshoff, the younger of the two brothers connected
in yacht-building, and the designer, brought out the 'Shadow,' 37 ft.
over all, a sloop whose fame is still fresh in the mind of every
yachtsman in America. She has won more races than any American yacht,
and even to-day can give the best of the new yachts a very hard pull.
The 'Shadow' has the honour of being the first yacht built on what was
afterwards known as the 'compromise model'; that is, a design that
combines the beam of the American with the depth of the English yacht.
From her earliest performance 'Shadow' showed speed and admirable
qualities, but strangely enough, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span> her form was not reproduced
nor copied for nearly fifteen years, which may be accounted for in a
measure by her designer having deserted the yachting field and turned
his attention to steam engineering and to the designing of steam yachts.
Mr. Herreshoff, however, did not wholly abandon his interest in sailing
vessels, and occasionally put forth a sailing yacht, or more properly
boat, one of which, the cat-boat 'Gleam,' was very famous for speed both
in native and English waters.</p>

</div>

<p>Another well-known cat was 'Alice,' 1879; she took twelve first prizes
out of eleven starts during her first year, in one race there having
been two prizes offered. During the ten years from 1860 to 1870,
covering the period of the War of the Rebellion, yachting interests were
at a low ebb, and comparatively few pleasure vessels of any kind were
built.</p>

<p>A change presently came over the fancy of yachtsmen, which was shown by
a feeling against large sloops, mostly on account of their being
difficult in management. The long boom is always an element of danger
and inconvenience, so that during the period alluded to many of the old
sloops were rigged into schooners, and toward the latter part of the
decade schooners became more successful and popular on account of their
ease in handling, and their being far better adapted for ocean cruising,
which at that time became more and more general with the owners of
pleasure craft. The coming of 'Cambria' in 1870, and later of 'Livonia,'
seemed to act as a stimulant in the construction of schooners, and many
were built and found to be very satisfactory and successful. A list of
the best known and most successful schooners that existed about 1870 and
1871 would include:&mdash;'Phantom,' 123 tons; 'Maggie,' 132 tons; 'Sylvie,'
106 tons; 'Tidal Wave,' 153 tons; 'Madeleine,' 148 tons; 'Rambler,' 160
tons; 'Idler,' 133 tons; 'Dauntless,' 268 tons; 'Magic,' 97 tons;
'Fleetwing,' 206 tons; 'Palmer,' 194 tons; 'Alice,' 83 tons; 'Fleur de

'Tarolenta,' 204 <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> tons; 'Alarm,' 225 tons; 'Vesta,' 201 tons;
'Wanderer,' 187 tons; 'Columbia,' 206 tons; 'Sappho,' 310 tons;
'Enchantress,' 277 tons; 'Mohawk,' launched in June, 1875, 326 tons;
'Ambassadress,' 1877, 431 tons; 'Intrepid,' 1878, 276 tons; 'Grayling,'
1883, 91 ft. long, 136 tons, designed by Philip Elsworth, remodelled by
Burgess in 1888; 'Montauk,' Elsworth designer, 1882, 193 tons; 'Sea
Fox,' 1888, designed and owned by A. Cass Canfield, 204 tons.</p>

<p>Some very fast sloops appeared after 1860, but in less number than
before that date. The following list covers those that were best known
and noted for speed:&mdash;the 'Mannersing,' built by David Kirby, Rye, New
York, launched June 11, 1858, 58 ft. over all, 54 ft. 4 in. length on
water-line, 18 ft. beam, 5 ft. 1 in. deep, and 4 ft. draught,
centreboard, 24 tons; she was very fast, won three races out of five,
was later owned in New Bedford, where she was wrecked. The 'Mallory,'
built by D. D. Mallory, 1858, 55 ft. over all, 51 ft. length on
water-line, 18 ft. beam, 6 ft. deep, 5 ft. draught, a very handsome and
fast vessel, 45 tons; she was lost at sea on a voyage from Havanna to
New York, no survivors. The 'Annie,' built by Albertson Brothers,
Philadelphia, designed by Robert Fish, 1861, 53 ft. over all, 45 ft. 6
in. length on water-line, 18 ft. beam, 4 ft. 2 in. deep, 3 ft. 6 in.
draught, centreboard. 'Annie' was first owned by Mr. Anson Livingston,
who was the best amateur yachtsman of that day; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span> he sailed
'Annie' in five races and won them all; she was finally shipped to
California on the deck of the vessel 'Three Brothers,' and is now doing
very satisfactory duty in the Bay of San Francisco. 'Addie,' V. sloop,
built by David Kirby for William Voorhis, 1867, 65 ft. 10 in. over all,
57 ft. length on water-line and 17 ft. beam, 5 ft. 4 in. deep, 4 ft. 4
in. draught, centreboard; she was but fairly fast, and underwent many
changes. 'Coming,' sloop, centreboard, designed by R. Fish, 1868, 62 ft.
over all, 57 ft. length on water-line, 20 ft. 3 in. beam, 5 ft. 5 in.
deep, 5 ft. draught, 53<sup>25</sup>/<sub>95</sub> tons; she was not at first fast, but
later, when owned in Boston, she developed very good speed, and won
several races.</p>

</div>

<p>'Gracie,' launched July 1868, was modelled and built by A. Polhemus at
Nyack, New York. Her dimensions were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> then 60 ft. 3 in. over
all, 58 ft. 6 in. water-line, 18 ft. 8 in. beam, 5 ft. 6 in. depth of
hold, and 5 ft. draught, centreboard lengthened 2 ft. aft in 1869. In
1874 she was lengthened to 72 ft. 9 in. over all, 62 ft. water-line, 20
ft. 6 in. beam, 6 ft. 6 in. depth of hold, and 5 ft. 8 in. draught. In
1879 she was again rebuilt and altered by David Cool at City Island, and
lengthened to about 80 ft. over all, with same water-line, a beam of 22
ft. 6 in., 7 ft. depth of hold, and 6 ft. 8 in. draught. Her mast was 74
ft. over all, topmast 36 ft., boom 63 ft., gaff 31 ft., whole length of
bowsprit, of which 19 ft. is outboard. That was the dimension she had
when she sailed with the 'Bedouin,' the 'Puritan,' and 'Priscilla.' She
was again altered in 1886, giving her 16 tons inside ballast, the rest
on the keel.</p>

<p>When she was launched her tonnage, old measurement, was 54<sup>45</sup>/<sub>95</sub>; to-day

<p>Such are the changes made in old yachts now-a-days. A new one every
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span> year is all the fashion; no alteration of originals, but new
lines entirely.</p>

<p>The following were notable yachts:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sloop 'Madeleine,' built by David Kirby, Rye, New York, and launched
March, 1869, designed by J. Voorhis. Length over all 70 ft., 65 ft.
length on water-line, 21 ft. beam, and 7 ft. 9 in. deep, 6 ft. 6 in.
draught. In her original form she was a failure, but in 1870 was changed
to a schooner. After alterations to her design of hull in 1871 and again
in 1873, she became a fast yacht, and was chosen to defend the 'America'
Cup against the 'Countess of Dufferin' in 1876.</p>

<p>The cutter 'Vindex,' built by Reanyson and Archibald in Chester,
Pennsylvania, in 1871, designed jointly by A. Cary Smith and her owner,
Robert Center. She is the first iron yacht built in this country, being
a new departure in design as well as rig, though not famous for speed,
and was not a racer; still she was an excellent vessel for cruising, and
was particularly comfortable in beating to windward in strong weather.
'Vindex' was 63 ft. overall, 56 ft. length on water-line, 17 ft. 4 in.
beam, 7 ft. 6 in. deep, 8 ft. 10 in. draught, keel, 68 tons.</p>

<p>The sloop 'Vixen,' centreboard, built by Albertson Bros., of
Philadelphia, for Anson Livingston, designed by R. Fish, 1871, length
overall 52 ft., 44 ft. length on water-line, 16 ft. 6 in. beam, 6 ft.
deep, 4 ft. 5 in. draught, 37 tons. Sailed thirty-seven races in the New
York Yacht Club, and won eighteen first prizes.</p>

<p>The sloop 'Fanny,' built by D. O. Richmond, in Mystic, Connecticut,
1873. Length over all 72 ft., 66 ft. length on water-line, 23 ft. 9 in.
beam, 6 ft. 9 in. deep, 5 ft. draught, centreboard, 90 tons. She sailed
twenty-six races in the New York Yacht Club, and won ten prizes. Sloop
'Arrow,' built by David Kerby for Daniel Edgar, 1874, 66 ft. 6 in. over
all, 61 ft. 8 in. length on water-line, 20 ft. 2 in. beam, 6 ft. 6 in.
deep, 5 ft. 6 in. draught, 69<sup>64</sup>/<sub>95</sub> tons. Her career was short and
creditable under the flag of the New York Yacht Club, she having, in her
first year, entered five races and won four prizes. Sloop 'Mischief,'
designed by A. Cary Smith, built by the Harlan <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span> Hollingsworth
Co., of Wilmington, Delaware, of iron, 1879; 67 ft. 6 in. over all, 61
ft. length on water-line, 19 ft. 11 in. beam, 7 ft. 9 in deep, 5 ft. 3
in. draught, 79<sup>27</sup>/<sub>95</sub> tons. 'Mischief' was chosen to defend the
'America' Cup against 'Atalanta' in 1881; she has sailed twenty-six
races and won eleven prizes. The sloop 'Pocahontas' was built by David
Kirby for a syndicate. Launched in 1881, she was 71 ft. 11 in. She was
intended to defend the 'America' Cup against 'Atalanta,' but was badly
beaten by 'Mischief' and 'Gracie,' and was retired, bearing the
well-deserved sobriquet 'Pokey.'</p>

<p>The sloop 'Priscilla' was built of iron by the Harlan Hollingsworth Co.,
Wilmington, Delaware, and designed by A. Cary Smith for James G. Bennett
and William Douglas, with a view to defend the 'America' Cup against
'Genesta,' but the trial races showed 'Puritan' to be the best yacht,
1885. She was sold in 1886 to A. Cass Canfield, who did all in his power
to bring her into racing form, but improvements in designing set her
hopelessly astern. 'Priscilla' was 95 ft. 6 in. over all, 85 ft. 3 in.
length on water-line, 22 ft. 6 in. beam, 8 ft. 9 in. deep, 8 ft.
draught, centreboard. She was rigged into a schooner in 1888, but as a
racer has never made a creditable record.</p>

<p>The sloop 'Atlantic' was built by J. F. Mumm at Bay Ridge, Long Island,
designed by Philip Elsworth for Latham A. Fish and others. She was built
to defend the 'America' Cup against 'Galatea,' but in the trial races
she was beaten by both 'Puritan' and 'Mayflower,' and was retired. In
1887 she was sold, and changed into a schooner. Length over all 95 ft.,
84 ft. 6 in. length on water-line, 23 ft. 2 in. beam, 9 ft. 6 in. deep,
9 ft. draught, centreboard, 159<sup>81</sup>/<sub>95</sub> tons.</p>

<p>Amongst designers of this period A. Cary Smith, whose name is mentioned
above, stands unquestionably first in New York; his boats were and are
to-day favourites amongst yachtsmen. It may be said of him that he
displayed good sense in designing, and whilst his productions have not
been famous as racers, still they are by no means the last to return;
and when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span> we consider qualities of staunchness, trustworthiness
of working in stress of weather, and all except the extreme of speed,
his yachts have not been excelled. In late years, beside yacht
designing, Mr. Smith has taken up the modelling of fast screw and
side-wheel steamers for special passenger coastwise traffic, in which
line his skill has proved pre-eminent; vessels of his design are to-day
the fastest afloat, and, like his other work, are marked by evidence of
perfect understanding of the requirements; in short, he builds for the
special use demanded, and therefore his labours are followed by success.</p>

<p>He first came before the public in 1871, when he jointly with Robert
Center designed the iron cutter 'Vindex,' at Chester, Pennsylvania. Then
he built the schooner 'Prospero,' and it was said that he laid down the
lines from paper draughts without having a model, which was at that time
a great fad. Then he designed and built the 'Norna' and 'Intrepid,'
'Mina,' 'Iroquois,' and 'Zampa'; he has now designed and is
superintending the building of two schooners, two ferry-boats, and one
'Sound' steamer. He is also a fine marine artist, and has painted many
noted yachts: the 'Sappho' for Commodore Douglas, and 'Dauntless' for
Commodore Bennett, the 'Wanderer,' 'Columbia,' the 'Vindex,'and many
other celebrated yachts.</p>

<p>About twenty years after the organisation of the New York Yacht Club,
the Brooklyn Yacht Club was formed, and, soon following it, the Atlantic
Yacht Club appeared. The new clubs were composed of men who owned
generally a smaller class of yachts than that in the older club, but
their members were interested and active, and races were held in early
summer and in autumn, as well as a cruise to Newport in midsummer.</p>

</div>

<p>The desire for club formation was prevalent in Boston about the same
time that the Brooklyn and Atlantic were started. The Boston Club was a
promising institution, and called together a very respectable fleet of
yachts; races and cruises were held, and much discussion on, and
comparison of, designs <span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> were indulged in, to the decided
advantage of the style of rig and general management of pleasure craft
both in cruising and racing.</p>

<p>Early in the '70's there appeared a sudden disposition to form yachting
clubs wherever a handful of boats could be found with owners living near
each other. Club after club was started, many of which were short-lived,
but in a little time the discordant elements were separated, and in all
the clubs that now exist can be found a healthy social spirit, and a
true disposition to advance the cause of yachting by the encouragement
of Corinthian races and cruises. With the organisation of the Seawanhaka
Yacht Club of New York, and the Eastern Yacht Club in Boston, the circle
of really important clubs seems to be filled; but it is to-day easy to
find as many as twenty-five or thirty clubs scattered from Maine to
Florida, whose influence and example offer encouragement to the
promotion of social intercourse and yacht designing.</p>

<p>About the year 1880 there began to arise amongst yachtsmen a feeling of
uneasiness in respect of the design of yachts then in vogue, and for so
many years in successful use.</p>

<p>It was the natural sequence of the gradual change that was being wrought
in the surroundings of the class that seek pastimes, and with increase
of leisure and wealth there came a desire for more seaworthy vessels;
cruising had then become a settled thing, and a winter's cruise in
southern waters was no unusual event. The ever-increasing communication
with England, and consequent friendly intercourse, led directly to a
desire on the part of many American yachtsmen to adopt a design&mdash;if not
an exact copy&mdash;something more after the style of the English yacht.</p>

<p>The sad accident to the 'Mohawk' also had its influence in unsettling
our faith in the wide, flat model, and in 1881, when the 'Madge' came in
amongst us and showed what speed and weatherly qualities were present in
the English design, and when also the cutter 'Clara' drove home and
clinched the work the 'Madge' had begun, there then set in a regular
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> <em>furore</em> amongst American designers and yachtsmen for something
that was different from the then accepted forms of hull and styles of
rig. In 1885, when it became necessary to defend the 'America' Cup
against 'Genesta,' it dawned on the yachting fraternity that a stroke
must be made or the much-prized trophy would return to its native
shores.</p>

<img src="images/img136.jpg" width="400" height="364" alt="" title="">
<p>'Puritan,' 1885 (General Paine, N.Y.Y.C.)</p>
</div>

<p>As usually happens in a country of progressive and intelligent people,
the need calls forth its own means of cure, and Edward Burgess came to
the front with a solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p>The new designer created nothing newer than a refinement of what
existed in the sloop 'Shadow,' built fourteen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> years before; but
his clever combination of what is best in English and American designs
gave us in the 'Puritan' a vessel of which a designer might well be
proud. The nation was satisfied with her performance, and grateful to
her promulgator. The success of the cutter 'Puritan' at once placed Mr.
Burgess in advance of all American designers, and at the same time her
form and rig were pronounced to be entirely successful, and from that
moment the compromise model, as it was called, became established on
what has proved most firm foundation; for it has not only revolutionised
designing in America, but has had a very marked influence on the form of
yachts in England, to their evident improvement&mdash;at least, it is natural
to conclude that the best of two widely divergent results in yacht
designing would lie in a middle position between the two.</p>

<p>In 1886 Burgess brought out the cutter 'Mayflower' to meet 'Galatea,'
but the former yacht had small need of her superiority over 'Puritan,'
for 'Mayflower' easily beat her opponent, and again the cup renewed its
length of days on this side of the ocean.</p>

<p>In 1887 a most determined and well-planned movement was made by Scottish
yachtsmen against the 'America' Cup. It was beyond question the most
hard-fought battle in yachting that had occurred up to that date, but
the hastily built 'Volunteer,' also designed by Mr. Burgess, proved
again that it was no easy task to carry off the cup that had then been
fully naturalised by a residence in this land of thirty-six years.</p>

<p>The much-coveted cup now enjoyed a season of comparative rest, and year
after year the new design became stronger and more securely established
in the good opinion of American as well as English yachtsmen. The old
question of centreboard <i lang="la"><abbr title="versus">v.</abbr></i> keel still vexed the minds of those
interested, and without doubt it will be long insoluble; but seeing that
both have inalienable advantages, both types of construction will be
used so long as a demand for yachts for varying conditions shall exist.
Let it be admitted, however, that the newest design of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> keel
yachts have their form below water so shaped as to very nearly resemble
a centreboard, and the best shape of centreboard yachts have lateral
resistance enough to do fairly good work to windward with their board
drawn up; so in this particular, as in the general form of the hull, the
best practice lies in combining both devices. It must also be freely
admitted that for the pure comfort and pleasure of sailing, for an
appreciation of the inspiriting motion, as well as for the comfort of
increased deck and cabin room, nothing yet has exceeded the form of
yacht now falling into disuse; and for the pleasure of sailing on the
usually smooth waters of our sheltered bays, and wafted by the moderate
breezes that are most frequently found, nothing can surpass for pure
enjoyment the cat-boat of middle size, say about 25 ft. in length.</p>

<p>In 1888, the lovers of racing pinned their faith to the 30-foot class,
and Burgess's fame rose higher and higher. He became the idol of his
countrymen; a gift of 10,000 dollars indicated in some measure the
regard of his admiring friends, and really he deserved it: he was gentle
and unassuming in manner, always courteous, and interested not only in
his favourite profession, for unlike many gifted men he had more than
one side. His love for and knowledge of natural history were scarcely
less remarkable than his skill in the pursuit to which he devoted all
his time during the last four years of his life. Mr. Burgess was for
many years secretary of the Natural History Association of Boston, and
resigned that position only when forced by pressure of business,
consequent on the supervision of construction and fitting out of the
many yachts that he yearly put forth. The appended list and dimensions
of some of the best known and most successful of Mr. Edward Burgess's
yachts is interesting as showing the change in chief proportions of the
several yachts as compared with craft of the older design.</p>

</div>

<p>At this time the minds of our yachtsmen were sorely fretted by the
performance of the cutter 'Minerva' from Scotland. She laid all low who
dared to wrestle with her, and not until the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>(p. 263)</span> concentrated
strength of our great designer was invoked could she be beaten. Even
then the 'Gossoon' could not always outstrip her, but the newly
developed skill that she set in motion did not rest with the beating of
'Minerva,' and to-day she would have no chance. Great strides were made
in 1891, placing on an even footing the famous 46-foot class with yachts
of 20 ft. superior length.</p>

<p class="p2">The year of 1891 was famous in bringing to a climax the development of
the new idea; several new designers of merit appeared, notably Mr.
William Gardiner of New York. His 'Lyris' was a marvel of speed, and in
her class she was well nigh invincible. 1891, indeed, opened with every
nerve at the highest tension. One incident was the return of Mr. N. G.
Herreshoff to the field of sail-yacht designing from which he had
retired nineteen years before. To add to the interest and excitement,
several designers contributed their skill in forming the famous class of
46-footers that rendered that season long remembered in yachting annals.
Burgess had four, and Fife of Scotland, General Paine of Boston,
Herreshoff of Bristol, and J. R. Maxwell of New York, each sent one
yacht to the lists; so the new fleet represented, not only well-tried
skill, but the work of several who were new in the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span> No one of the fleet of racers attracted so much interest and
discussion as the cutter 'Gloriana,' keel, the Herreshoff production;
she was a decided departure from accepted forms, and destined to create
a revolution in the science of naval architecture.</p>

<p>Criticism was poured upon 'Gloriana' from every side&mdash;a very few thought
she might sail moderately fast, but the majority who expressed their
minds all united in declaring that nothing but abject failure could
follow such an act of boldness as her model appeared to all but her
designer, and perhaps her owner, Mr. E. D. Morgan.</p>

<a id="img138" name="img138"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img138.jpg" width="400" height="319" alt="" title="">
<p>'Gossoon,' keel boat, 1890. Designed by E. Burgess.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Herreshoff, however, had built a small craft in the autumn of 1890
which was on much the same lines as 'Gloriana,' except that the latter
was a more complete representative of the new system; the trial boat of
the previous autumn showed qualities in sailing and handling that gave
the designer of 'Gloriana' courage to proceed with a craft that called
forth general condemnation before she was launched, a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span> feeling
which was quickly changed to astonishment and approval as soon as she
was tried against other members of her class. The feature of 'Gloriana'
that marked her amongst all other yachts of that season was her abnormal
overhang, showing a length over all of 70 ft. to that on water of 45 ft.
3 in.</p>

<p>This unusual degree of overhang gave an opportunity for the elongation
of the body of the yacht, the fulness of the bilge being extended quite
to the extreme point of the bow and stern.</p>

<a id="img139" name="img139"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img139.jpg" width="400" height="320" alt="" title="">
<p>'Gloriana,' 1892. Designed by Herreshoff.</p>
</div>

<p>The lines of 'Gloriana's' entrance seemed almost bluff; but owing to the
flare of that portion of the hull where contact is first made with the
water, she appeared to roll it underneath her in a manner that disposed
of the displacement more easily than by the nearly vertical sides of the
usual wedge-shaped bow; at least if one could judge from the very slight
and superficial character of the 'fuss' made around her bow, and also by
the diminished effect of the wave under the lee bow to turn the yacht to
windward (shown by her very easy helm), the inference is clear that
this form of entrance does its <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> work with less expended power
than the old form. Another most advantageous result of the elongation of
the body of 'Gloriana' is the fact that when she plunges into rough
water the part of the hull immersed by pitching presents lines that are
just as long and easy as those shown when the yacht is sailing in smooth
water.</p>

<p>This feature of 'Gloriana's' performance gives her a higher rate of
speed when compared with yachts of old type at times and conditions when
the speed of all the old formed yachts suffer a marked diminution.</p>

<p>Besides the fact of a gain in speed with a given power, this form
affords an increase of space below as well as on deck, and if the vastly
increased buoyancy be considered, enabling the yacht to carry greater
spread of sail and carry it well, it will be seen what a really
important improvement was demonstrated in 'Gloriana.' She sailed during
her maiden season eight races and took eight first prizes&mdash;a clean
record&mdash;and with the exception of one race all were sailed with her
largest club topsail set. Had she met with fairly rough water, as
occurred on one of the races, her superior sailing qualities would have
stood forth in even stronger contrast.</p>

<p>The yachting season of 1891 was clouded by the death of Mr. Burgess,
which happened soon after the close of the June races, the result of
which he never knew, as the defeat of his 'Syanara' and 'Mineola' was
never told him. By his death, yachting received a blow from which it may
not quickly recover; he enjoyed to the utmost the regard and gratitude
of the public, the measure of which was shown by the voluntary creation
of a fund for the education of his children.</p>

<p>As was predicted, the season of 1892 was not as exciting as the previous
year; the 46-foot class received a new member in the cutter 'Wasp,' from
the Herreshoff hand; she was an advance on 'Gloriana'&mdash;the same ideas
more fully developed&mdash;the changes being in part suggested by or taken
from the design of a new type of boat afterwards called 'fin-keel,' the
first of which craft was launched and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> tried in the autumn of
1891; but of this more will be said later.</p>

<p>'Wasp' found as opponents her sister 'Gloriana,' now passed from the
hands of her original owner and from good management, and the reformed
'Beatrix,' a centreboard cutter of 1891, now worked by the Adams
Brothers, two of the most acute yachtsmen in the country, who so
improved the 'Harpoon,' as they renamed her, that for a time it was
thought 'Wasp' would be out-sailed; but except in the Goelet cup race
off Newport, when 'Wasp's' skipper made a capital blunder, the
Herreshoff flyer made a record but little less clean than that of
'Gloriana' in 1891. 'Gloriana' took third place to the 'Harpoon's'
second, the result of poor handling, and in a degree to the constantly
prevailing light winds in which all the races were sailed, light club
topsails being carried in every instance.</p>

</div>

<p>A novel and interesting feature of the yachting season of 1892 was the
'fin-keel' boat, a production of N. G. Herreshoff. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span> It will be
seen from the cut below that some of the peculiarities of the 'Gloriana'
form are embodied in this singular craft&mdash;namely, the long overhang and
the rounded elongation of the bilge to the extreme limits of the bow and
stern.</p>

<p>The chief characteristic, however, is the fin, or in effect a fixed
centreboard carrying a weight of lead on its lower edge sufficient to
give the craft stability enough to balance the rigging and press of wind
in the sails.</p>

<p>The most successful fin-keel boats have a length on water equal to
three-and-a-half beams, and as the section of the hull is round or
nearly so, stability is gained in a manner already explained.</p>

<p>Fin-keel and bulb.</p>
</div>

<p>The first of this style of craft was built and launched in the autumn of
1891, and was called 'Dilemma'; she had a very moderate-sized rig, the
jib-stay being secured to the extreme point of the bow, but with this
she easily beat the old style of cat-boat, and showed, besides unusual
speed, many other desirable qualities.</p>

<p>In 1892 the fin-keel boat was generally introduced, three or four
sailing in Boston waters, while New York, the Lakes, and Buzzard's Bay
claimed one each to two in their home waters of Narragansett Bay.</p>

<p>'Consuelo,' cat-yawl.</p>
</div>

<p>The 'Wenona' and 'Wee Winn,' the first in the North and the latter in
the South of England, showed our friends on the other side of the sea
what their racing qualities were, which are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span> soon told by
referring to their record. Out of twenty starts made by 'Wenona' she won
17 first, 2 second, and 1 third prizes, and her sister in the South was
even more fortunate, winning 20 first and 1 second prizes out of
twenty-one starts. The fin-keel type at home was almost as successful,
except when brought into competition with a centreboard boat of sloop
rig, 21 ft. length on water-line, called 'Alpha.' She was built and
designed by the projector of the fin-keels, and was the chief member of
a large 21-foot class that was fully exploited in Boston during the
season of 1892, where the 'Alpha' won in every race she entered. The
value of the fin-keel type in adding to the resources of yachting is
limited; the type does not contribute anything of living value to
yachting, it serves only as a means to show that old types can easily be
beaten, but that it takes a 'machine' to do it. Fin-keels are, it is
true, very pleasant to sail in, and they work beautifully, but the
design is probably limited in size to 35- or 40-ft. water-line in
length, for above that size the fin becomes a very troublesome adjunct
in its handling and adjustment. When the boat is afloat the fin is not
objectionable, but in taking the bottom by accident, or in hauling it
out, it makes the boat most troublesome to handle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> Larger fin-keel boats have been projected, and one of 45 ft.
length on water-line has just been built, but their success from a
general view-point is highly questionable. Mr. N. G. Herreshoff, in
1883, introduced a very useful rig, which was first tested to his
complete satisfaction on 'Consuelo.' These boats are styled 'cat-yawl,'
and since their introduction the type has become very popular, and most
deservedly so, as for ordinary sailing, and particularly cruising, the
rig offers many important advantages. In reefing the mainsail is
accessible, and the absence of the long boom of the cat-boat is readily
appreciated.</p>

<p>The rig of the cat-yawl has been applied successfully to all designs of
yacht, deep and moderate beam as well as the shallow broad type, and
always with increasing satisfaction. The rig, however, seems to be
confined to boats not over 40 ft. length on water-line, as, the mainmast
being placed so near the bow, it is impossible to stay it, and too large
a mast unstayed is not desirable in a cruising boat.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img143.jpg" width="250" height="133" alt="" title="">
<p>Herreshoff catamaran.</p>
</div>

<p>The proportions between the mainsail and jigger as recommended by the
projector is 4 in the former to 1 in the latter&mdash;that is, the dimensions
of the jigger should be exactly one-half those of the mainsail. Mr.
Herreshoff is also responsible for another marine curiosity that
appeared in 1876. This was a catamaran or double-hulled boat&mdash;intended
to be handled by one man. This boat differs from its kinsfolk of the
southern ocean, the point of widest departure being that the hulls are
connected by flexible means, so that each hull can adjust itself to the
surface of the water it moves in.</p>

<p>The means employed in forming this flexible union were through the
agency of a complex system of ball-and-socket joints which had range of
motion enough, so that one hull <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span> might be riding a wave, whilst
its sister would be in the depths of a hollow.</p>

<p>A small tray-shaped car for passengers, and the mast and rigging, were
supported between and above the hulls by a system of truss-work with
adjustible tension rods of iron.</p>

<p>These catamarans carried a mainsail and jib, and in smooth water made
wonderful speed; 21 miles an hour has been attained under favourable
conditions. This aquatic marvel was not destined to become popular; the
boats required special skill in their management, and were best
calculated for an afternoon's sail in smooth, sheltered water. The
absence of anything like cabin accommodations was also against their
use, but cruising has been successfully accomplished in them through the
use of a tent to make shelter, covering the car, and of sufficient
height for one to stand under it.</p>

<p>Newport (centreboard) cat-boat.</p>
</div>

<p>The respect of all dwellers on the shore is due to the cat-boat. She is
distinctly American, and whilst her use may be more and more
circumscribed, still the old cat will live and continue to fill a place
that no other rig could do. But the cat-boat in the usual acceptation
means something more than its simple rig; it stands for a shallow, wide
boat, with one mast crowded into the extreme bow, and a boom reaching
far over <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span> the stern, as in the cut on p. 271. The 'cat' is seen
on our seaboard from Maine to Florida, but 95 per cent. of all yachting
and boating is done north of the capes of the Delaware. In this
connection it is not out of place to speak of our very large fleet of
small yachts and of boats for sailing and cruising which from their size
may not properly be called yachts.</p>

<p>The number of these craft is legion, they swarm in every northern port,
and in a few places in the south are frequently met; their rig is always
of the sloop for the larger, and for the smaller&mdash;say below 25-ft.
water-line&mdash;the cat-rig is in preponderance. The value of this 'Mosquito
fleet' as a school for yachting cannot be over-estimated.</p>

<p>The fancy for cruising in small sloops or cat-boats has increased
greatly of late, and as the type of craft for this work improves it will
become a very general pastime.</p>

<p>It is not here intended to cast too deep a slur on the cat-boats; seeing
that the wind and weather are so generally moderate and dependable on
our coast, cruising can safely be done in a cat of moderate rig. Even in
heavy weather, if properly handled, a cat is sure to come in to port
with flying colours, as the writer can attest by his own experience.</p>

<p>There are several other types of boats seen on the Atlantic coast of the
United States and British Provinces; they vary in design of hull as well
as in the rig, and are adapted to the work required and the surrounding
condition of weather and water. They are mostly modifications of the old
pirogue, and as a rule are more used in trade or some occupation than
for pleasure.</p>

<p>Since yacht and boat racing began, there have been many different plans
suggested for measurement, and for allowance between contending craft of
different length.</p>

<p>The same questions still agitate the mind of the yachtsman, and
doubtless will for all time; but if the subject be wisely considered, it
will be found that that system of measurement that conduces to the best
form of hull and moderate-sized sail-spread is to be preferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> It is mainly owing to the differing systems of measurement that
the English and American designs are so widely separated; extreme depth
with a minimum breadth in the first, and broad, shallow vessels in the
latter. It must be said, however, that sailing conditions had quite as
much influence in dividing the types as measurement, but in the new
compromise design all differences are happily united, and, be the water
rough or smooth, the weather light or heavy, the new types will answer
all requirements of speed or seaworthiness.</p>

<p>The present idea of measurement that embraces sail-area and length is
without question a very sensible one&mdash;surely, indeed, the best yet
devised&mdash;but the tables of allowance cannot make just equality between
vessels of widely different size, nor do they make just allowance
between yachts of varying size in or under all conditions of wind. A
system of measurement that will conduce to the construction of vessels
of normal design and rig, and a table of allowance that will equalise
yachts in any force of wind and condition of sea, are desiderata most
devoutly wished for by all who are interested in the development of the
yacht, and especially in racing. The sail of a yacht is such an
essential factor in its performance that some words respecting makers of
duck and of the sails themselves are not out of place.</p>

<p>The quality of duck as to evenness of the spinning and weaving of the
component yarns, and also the equality in the staple itself, are both
factors of the utmost importance when the ultimate 'set' of the sail is
considered. These inequalities in material, in conjunction with the
personal differences of the men employed in sewing, all combine to make
the set of the sail a very unknown quantity, and the differences can be
removed only by the utmost care in making duck and in selection of
sewers. A wholly satisfactory setting sail is a very rare sight on an
American yacht, mainly on account of the uncertain characteristics of
the duck, and only within the last year, as a result of the highly
commendable efforts of Mr. Adrian Wilson, of the firm of Wilson &amp;
Silsby, sailmakers of Boston, has duck been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> produced that can
stand comparison with that made in England for the exclusive use of
Lapthorn. The thanks of all earnest yachtsmen are due to Mr. Wilson for
his interest and untiring labours in inducing the makers of yarn and
weavers of duck to produce an article that will meet the difficult
requirements of a racing sail.</p>

<p>Wilson &amp; Silsby of Boston and John Sawyer &amp; Co. of New York are
considered the best sailmakers in America; but many others enjoy a good
reputation: and now that really good duck can be obtained, it is hoped
that better setting sails will be more easily obtained than heretofore.</p>

<p>'Constellation,' 1889, New York Club. Designed by E.
Burgess.</p>
</div>

<p>Many of our yachtsmen possess skill in designing, and are also fully
capable of supervising and directing the construction of a yacht as well
as her rigging and fitting out; and when that is done they can take the
helm, and under their guidance <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> their craft will be as well
handled as by the best professional skipper.</p>

<p>Prominent among these skilled yachtsmen in New York is Mr. E. D. Morgan,
Commodore of the New York Yacht Club, who in the height of his yachting
career owned a whole harbour full of yachts, ranging from an
ocean-cruising steamer to a naphtha launch in machine-propelled craft,
and from a first-class schooner yacht to a cat-yawl amongst the sailing
vessels. Others but a degree less devoted and skilful are Messrs. J. R.
Maxwell, A. Cass Canfield, L. A. Fish, Archibald Rogers; and, in Boston,
General Charles J. Paine, Mr. C. H. W. Foster, Com. J. Mal. Forbes,
Messrs. George C. Adams, C. F. Adams, jun., Bayard Thayer, Charles A.
Prince, John Bryant, Henry Bryant, Gordon Dexter. The chief designers in
New York are Messrs. Winteringham, Gardiner, and A. C. Smith; whilst in
Boston, Messrs. Stuart &amp; Binney and Waterhouse &amp; Chesebro are amongst
the best known; but many others scattered along our seaboard have
designed and built most creditable yachts, and occasionally a craft is
turned out that rivals the productions of the best and most experienced
designers.</p>

<p>Yachting on the waters of the British Possessions in North America has
developed rapidly, and, fostered by the formation of clubs, and the
establishment of regular seasons for racing and cruising, there is no
doubt that the improvement of design and rig will progress
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The seaboard of the British Provinces is well adapted for cruising and
racing, and due advantage is taken of all yachting facilities on the
coast as well as on the Great Lakes, and to a considerable extent on the
St. Lawrence River.</p>

<p>In glancing over the yachting situation in the United States there is
every reason to feel satisfied with what has been accomplished; all
improvements in design and rig have been eagerly adopted by our
yachtsmen, and if we have drawn from the English in some points, they
have been fully repaid by gleanings from American practice. Yachting is
appreciated in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> other localities than on the seaboard, with its
bays and rivers; the great lakes have a small fleet of pleasure vessels,
and on some of the smaller lakes, as Minnietonka in Minnesota, racing is
carried to a degree of perfection wholly unsurpassed by the owners'
salt-water friends.</p>

<p>During the season of international matches, in 1885-87, the public
interest awakened was extreme; reports of the racing were read with
interest from Maine to California. When there is no international work
on hand, the chief yachting event of the year is the cruise of the New
York Yacht Club. Following the lead of 'Gimcrack,' in 1884, the cruise
always takes place during the first week in August, embracing also a
part or whole of the second.</p>

<p>Starting from a port on the Sound easily accessible from the city of New
York, the squadron makes its way eastward, stopping at several of the
principal places of resort along the Sound.</p>

<p>Of late years it has been the custom to race from port to port, regular
entries being made and prizes awarded.</p>

<p>At every port along its course the New York Yacht Squadron receives
large augmentations of both sailing and steam yachts, so that at last,
when the fleet anchors in the harbour of New London, it is an armada of
pleasure craft laden with pleasure-seeking yachtsmen, all in accord to
make this demonstration the brightest and gayest event of the season.
The entrance of the squadron into Narragansett Bay is one of the most
beautiful of all imaginable marine pictures; the ranks are then
complete, often numbering 200 vessels, by steam and sail. Every
available craft is pressed into service by the dwellers of Newport and
vicinity to go out to meet the arriving yachts; steamers laden with
passengers, tugs, trading schooners with their decks black with unusual
freight, the ubiquitous cat-boat, all assemble in waiting off the
Lightship at Brenton's Reef to welcome the approaching fleet that is
already coming into view off Point Judith.</p>

<p>The yacht squadron is escorted to the beautiful harbour of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span>
Newport by the motley fleet in attendance, and anchors there with a
flutter of canvas and the booming of cannon.</p>

<a id="img146" name="img146"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img146.jpg" width="400" height="406" alt="" title="">
<p>The ubiquitous cat-boat.</p>
</div>

<p>At evening the fleet is illuminated with coloured lights, the steam
yachts contribute electric glare, forming a scene worth many miles of
journeying to witness. Then follow races in the open sea outside
Newport, after which the cruise is continued to New Bedford, and
Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard Island; more racing, and then a cruise
around Cape Cod to Boston, where more racing and much festivity is
enjoyed, after which the squadron disbands, most of the yachts return to
Newport, whilst others cruise to Mount Desert Island and beyond. About
the middle of August it is usual to have more racing off <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span>
Newport under the auspices of the Atlantic and Seawanhaka Clubs, and
this usually closes the season for racing; a few matches, however, are
generally expected in the autumn, but by the middle of October nearly
all the yachts go out of commission.</p>

<p>Winter cruising to Florida and the West Indies usually begins soon after
Christmas, returning early in April, whereby the rigours of our northern
winter are avoided.</p>

<p>As a rule, the American yachtsman is not inclined to racing to an extent
that would afford the best information and knowledge as to the design
and rig of his craft. At times, however, when under the stimulus of
rivalry of designers, as occurred in 1891, or particularly when there is
an international contest on hand, our marine phalanx stand forth in
battle array, sacrifice no end of personal effort, and stake willingly
their bottom dollar.</p>

<p>It is the earnest wish of every American yachtsman to encourage frequent
and friendly intercourse with his English cousins who are working for
the true interest and advancement <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span> of yacht designing. The
breadth of the interlying ocean and the disparity between the winds and
water of the two countries should make no barrier to closer relations,
to the end that the noble science of naval architecture and its most
useful teachings may find in the progress of yachting a fit subject to
bind more and more closely two nations of one blood, one language, and
one desire&mdash;to attain to that which is highest and best even in sports
and pastimes.</p>

<p>The valuable assistance of Mr. Niels Olsen, superintendent of the New
York Yacht Club, and of Mr. E. A. Stevens, of Hoboken, nephew of
Commodore J. C. Stevens, is hereby gratefully recognised. But for them
my work would have been difficult, and in many respects impossible.</p>

<h3>STEAM YACHTING IN AMERICA</h3>

<p>The rapid development of the steam engine as a motive power, and its
widely distributed application, soon attracted the attention of the
lovers of nautical sports, and before the year 1860 the all-conquering
engine began to be used for the propulsion of pleasure craft. The
invasion of fields of sport by the engine did not then recommend, nor
has it since recommended, itself to the hearts of true yachtsmen; all
that is so attractive in yachting seems to vanish as soon as the element
of uncertainty is eliminated: all the poetry of motion, all the sense of
freedom from disagreeable surroundings, as well as all interest in winds
and water&mdash;all are sunk when the sail is changed for the engine as a
propelling force.</p>

<p>The steam yacht should be considered chiefly in the light of a very
agreeable mode of locomotion, and as such it is unquestionably a very
desirable adjunct to our resources, filling as it does a place that
would be wholly impossible for sailing craft, when the uncertain
character of winds and water is considered.</p>

<p>The first idea of steam yachting in America was realised in the famous
cruise of the 'North Star,' a side-wheel steamship <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span> of
2,004<sup>25</sup>/<sub>95</sub> tons, built for Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1852. She was
the most handsomely appointed vessel of her day, and sailed temporarily
under the flag of the New York Yacht Club, which fixed her identity as a
yacht, although she was built for merchant service.</p>

<p>The 'North Star,' brigantine rig, was built by Jeremiah Simonson, of
Green Point, Long Island. Length over all, 270 ft., 38 ft. beam, 28 ft.
6 in. depth, 16 ft. draught. She was fitted with two vertical beam
engines, cylinders 60 in. diameter by 10 ft. stroke; two boilers, 10 ft.
diameter by 24 ft. long; paddle-wheels, 34 ft. in diameter. She was
broken up at Cold Spring, Long Island, in 1870. The Aspinwalls were the
first promoters of real steam yachting, and as early as 1854 the
'Firefly' was launched by Smith &amp; Dimon, of New York, for Messrs. W. H.
Aspinwall and J. L. Aspinwall. Her length was 97 ft. 8 in. over all, 19
ft. beam, 5 ft. 2 in. hold, 3 ft. 9 in. draught, engines built by the
Morgan Iron Works, oscillating cylinders 20 by 36 in., locomotive
boiler, paddle-wheels 8 ft. 8 in. diameter, size of paddles 17 by 45 in.
She was sold to the United States Government for duty on the Coast
Survey Service&mdash;89<sup>93</sup>/<sub>95</sub> tons. 'Clarita,' built for Leonard W. Jerome by
Lawrence Faulkes Williams, 1864; length over all, 125 ft.; 121 ft. 9 in.
water-line, 22 ft. beam, 9 ft. depth, draught 11 ft. 6 in., 231<sup>30</sup>/<sub>95</sub>
tons. Engine by Novelty Iron Works, 2 cylinders 22 by 22 in., diameter
of screw 9 ft. 6 in. Sold to Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and is now
doing towing duty on the Kennebec River, Maine.</p>

<p>The 'Ocean Wave' was built for Mr. R. T. Loper by Reany &amp; Naeafy, of
Philadelphia, in 1865, iron. She was 87 ft. over all, 19 ft. beam, 7 ft.
depth, 2 cylinders each 12 by 18 in., 38 nominal horse-power. The Police
Department of Philadelphia bought her.</p>

<p>'Day-Dream,' composite construction, built by the Continental Iron
Works, Green Point, Long Island, for W. H. Aspinwall, 1871. Length over
all, 115 ft.; length on water-line, 109 ft.; beam, 19 ft.; depth of
hold, 5 ft.; draught of water, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> 7 ft. Her engine was built by
the Delamater Works of New York, vertical condensing, 2 cylinders each
14 by 14 in., one boiler 8 ft. long, diameter of screw 7 ft. 6 in., with
10 ft. pitch. She was sold to the United States Government for postal
service in the Gulf of Mexico, and is now at New Orleans.</p>

<p>The 'Day-Dream' was really the first successful steam yacht, and set the
type of pleasure craft for many years; in fact, it is but a few years
ago that the style called 'deck-house' yachts went out of use, and they
are at present almost entirely superseded by the deeper-hulled,
flush-deck yachts.</p>

<p>During the early Seventies the steam launch, or open yacht, rapidly
multiplied in numbers and seemed to fill a demand for afternoon sailing
in the sheltered waters of our seaports, and as preparatory to something
better they did good service.</p>

<p>The open steam-launch as then used was from 25 to 45 ft. long, and 6 to
8 ft. wide, usually with vertical engines, and used a pipe condenser and
boiler of upright form, generally of tubular construction. After the
open launch came the small yacht, having a small cabin enclosed mostly
by glass with a standing room aft. This very popular form is still much
used, and answers a widely sought demand for day sailing or short
cruising; the boats are usually about 45 to 70 ft. long, and from 8 to
10 ft. wide. This style of small yacht had no deck room that was
available for real use, but the standing room with an awning over it
with adjacent cabin made a very serviceable craft, in which cruising
could be done from May until October on our coast with perfect safety.</p>

<p>In those days 8 miles an hour was thought fast enough for anybody, but
in a few years, when the engine and boiler were both more perfected,
more speed was demanded, so that the type in question attained to 12 or
13 miles an hour, which in some cases has been pushed to 15, whilst the
speed of the open launch which at first was but 8 to 10 miles an hour,
reached, under the stimulus of popular desire and better motive power,
to 16 and even 20 miles an hour in quiet smooth water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span> About 1885 the flush-deck yacht became more popular, and most
deservedly so, as the style is superior in all essential points to the
old deck-house form. It is true that the cabin of the older form is
pleasanter, being lighter and more airy, but the strength of
construction gained by the flush deck, its broad expanse of deck
everywhere available for sitting and promenading, all these points of
advantage give the present form decidedly the first place in the
estimation of all lovers of steam yachting. Since 1880, steam yachting
has increased with prodigious rapidity, and, particularly since the
introduction of naphtha as a factor in motive power, our waters fairly
swarm with craft propelled by a machine.</p>

<p>In about the year 1884 a club was formed for steam-yacht owners only,
called the American Yacht Club, and for several years it offered prizes
to be run for in Long Island Sound; but steam-yacht racing did not
become popular, principally because of the danger of forcing machinery
to its utmost limit of safety, and also the difficulty of classifying
yachts of different size and power of engine. For the most part the
devotees of steam yachting are drawn from the general public without
special regard of the situation of their home, as a yacht can be kept on
the seaboard or on the lakes, whilst the owner may live far from the
sight and sound of the sea; the restless spirit of our countrymen
prompts them to embark into every scheme of pleasure-making, as well as
business enterprise.</p>

<p>Naturally, however, by far the greater number of steam-yacht owners have
their homes on or very near some navigable water, upon which they pursue
their favourite sport as a pastime only, or in connection with the daily
engagements of business life.</p>

<p>Many men of large means and wide business interests who may be seen
daily on Wall Street or in other centres of trade in New York have homes
on the head waters of Long Island Sound, or on the lower stretches of
the Hudson, whence they daily run to the city of New York in a steam
yacht, which, after landing its luxurious owner, waits until his day is
done in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> the city, and bears him again to a home of comfort and
quiet retreat.</p>

<p>Yachts used chiefly for such purposes are always fast; when the speed
falls below 20 miles an hour, their owners fret and fume, and wonder why
she is not doing as well as she might.</p>

<p>Steam yachts having abnormally high speed are occasionally seen in a
large yachting fleet. There are always a few men, who, from a love of
seeing their names in print and their movements and those of their yacht
recorded in the newspapers of the day, find that by tearing up the
waters of our bays and harbours with yachts which show a speed of 25
miles an hour, their fondest hope is realised; for every eye follows
them, and every reporter wastes his pencil in recording the performances
of the speedy craft. It is their delight on regatta days to dart about
amongst the fleet of yachts and craft of the lookers-on, and astonish
everybody by some new flight of speed or some skilful evolution. I am
happy to record, however, that the number of these flyers is small, and
becoming less: such speeds are attained only by great danger to life and
limb of those in charge of the machine, and an entire loss of comfort
from the violent vibration of the vessel; for she must be built as light
and carry as powerful machinery as possible, to give the results desired
by these morbid lovers of notoriety, who are no more yachtsmen than is
the man who takes a balloon trip so as to be seen by the crowd.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that comfort and pleasure can be, and doubtless are,
found on many steam yachts; for instance, a yacht of 125 ft. water-line,
by 19 ft. beam, with a well-kept flush-deck, a comfortable deck-house
forward, a large awning spread over all, the deck set out with Persian
rugs, tables, and comfortable rattan chairs, and a number of congenial
friends present, who are not tired of life and each other&mdash;I think no
one will deny that pleasure in the highest degree could be realised with
such surroundings.</p>

<p>Our prevailing pleasant weather during the yachting season, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span>
and the uniformly sheltered character of our waters, have had their
effect on the form and construction of steam yachts as well as those by
sail. Nearly 95 per cent. of all steam yachts in America are built
expressly for bay, harbour, and river work, and when it is necessary to
make any extended trip, as for instance to the coast of Maine, they
usually creep close along shore, moving cautiously from port to port.</p>

<p>We can, however, boast of a few deep-sea craft, as fine and seaworthy as
any pleasure vessels in the world, such as those owned by the late Jay
Gould, Mr. W. W. Astor, the Vanderbilts, and few others. The general
dimensions of many steam yachts are ruled by the probability of their
taking the passage through the Erie Canal, the locks of which are 100
ft. long and 17 ft. wide, and admit a vessel drawing 6 ft. of water.</p>

<p>There is a marked advantage in taking the Erie Canal to reach the great
lakes; with a vessel of proper size the passage of the canal is safe and
easy, whilst the trip around by the Gulf and River of St. Lawrence is
very long and surrounded by difficulties, although the voyage will
richly repay one for taking it, as it affords greater variety in sea and
landscape than any other possible in America. Steam yachting on the
great lakes is also increasing rapidly, and in the harbours of the large
cities, as Buffalo, Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Chicago,
many steam pleasure craft may be seen, usually of a length of 100 ft. or
less, so as to make their way to the salt water by the canal.</p>

<p>As in the case of sailing yachts, 95 per cent. of steam craft are to be
found north of the capes of the Delaware, but their numbers are
increasing south of that point more rapidly than their sailing sisters.
The Gulf and tributary waters as yet show very few pleasure craft of
either sort, and the Pacific coast, on account of the high cost of fuel,
is not the scene of steam yachting to any considerable extent.</p>

<p>In the Bay of San Francisco, however, are a large number of naphtha
launches that find very favourable water in that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span> shallow sea.
There is far less variety of form and rig among steam yachts than in any
other pleasure craft. The accepted form at present is a flush-deck
vessel with pole masts, triple-expansion engine, and some modification
of the old Belville boiler, a form that has many varieties, none of
which are satisfactory in more than a few points. They are generally
safe from explosion, but very short-lived, and difficult to manage.</p>

<p>The compound engine was introduced into yachting craft about the year
1875, and its success was as marked as in all other branches of marine
construction.</p>

<p>The triple-expansion engine was first used in 1884 with increased
success over its ancestor, the compound, and in 1888 the quadruple
engine was put into a few yachts; but it may be questioned if it
possesses any advantages over the triple for the general uses of
yachting.</p>

<p>The use of high-expansion engines not only results in a marked economy
of fuel, but, through a wide distribution of power and strain, far
greater durability is attained, as well as greater freedom from
vibration, which often imparts discomfort to the passengers, and injury
to the hull of the yacht.</p>

<p>With regard to the designing and construction of steam yachts, it seems
to be the aim of every designer and builder to try his hand at this
branch of naval architecture, and, as might naturally be expected, the
resultant vessel is too often an example of semi-successful work of the
novice, clumsy in form, construction, and machinery, rude in design and
ill fitted to its duty. Nearly all the deep-sea pleasure craft are built
on the Delaware, and as a rule are staunch, seaworthy vessels with good
speed, and generally satisfactory performance in all situations. The
Herreshoff Co., of Rhode Island, have passed No. 180 in steam vessels,
the larger number of which are small launches, a good proportion small
cabin yachts, and the rest of the every-day class of along-shore craft
which satisfy the desires of nearly all who find pleasure on our coast
in steam yachts. The Herreshoff Co. turns out the fastest vessels of
their class, and for general qualities are the best examples of careful
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span> designing and construction as applied to both hull and
machinery. They have the advantage of building every member of a yacht,
hull, engines, and boiler, so the result is more harmonious, and in the
main is more conducive to speed and that condition, called 'well
balanced,' which is so desirable in all steam vessels.</p>

<p>During the last five years naphtha engines, as applied to launches, have
been greatly improved, so that their use has become immensely popular.
They vary in size from 20 to 45 ft. in length, with speed from 6 to 10
miles an hour; in a measure they have displaced small steam launches as
tenders for yachts, and in many places where no great degree of skill is
required to run them; in fact, the ease of running and little time
required to start a launch are the chief reasons of their popularity, in
spite of the fact that they are noisy and malodorous.</p>

<p>The use of the steam yacht will, without doubt, continue to increase
more rapidly than the sailing craft, but there is not the least
probability that the latter will be superseded. In so large a community
of sea-loving people there will always be a few whose good taste and
love of true sport will guide them toward the sail as a means of motion,
and the forces of nature as motive power; but happy is he on whom
fortune smiles to the extent of enabling him to keep both a steam and
sailing yacht, for times do come when to reach an objective point is
highly desirable, and at other times nothing can give so much pleasure
as the quiet and peaceful sensation that is found only in a sailing
craft. There is room then for every yacht, both steam and sail; each
contributes to the pleasure of its owner, and each deserves our best
efforts to develop and make perfect that which contributes so largely to
our resources of enjoyment and healthful pastime.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span> CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="smaller">YACHTING IN NEW ZEALAND</span><br>
<span class="smaller"><span class="smcap">By the Earl of Onslow</span>, G.C.M.G., &amp;c.</span></h2>

<p>As has already been said, there exists every facility in our
Australasian Colonies both for cruising and racing. These colonial
waters are indeed the only ones in the world where yachting can be
enjoyed among our fellow-countrymen on summer seas and in a temperate
climate during that portion of the year when yachts are laid up in the
mud in England and yachtsmen shiver in the bitter winds, the fogs and
frosts of Northern Europe.</p>

<p>The travelling yachtsman may either take out his yacht with him, if she
be large enough, or if this be deemed to involve too great trouble and
expense, he will find but little difficulty in making arrangements to
hire a comfortable craft at the Antipodes.</p>

<p>The southern coast of Australia, though it possesses many beautiful
harbours, is washed by the great rollers of the Pacific, coming up
through the 'roaring forties' without anything to break their force,
straight from Antarctic regions, to dash themselves in mile-long
breakers against the Australian coast. Yachting is therefore better
confined to the sheltered harbours, and specially to those which have
been selected for the sites of the capital cities of Adelaide, Melbourne
and Sydney.</p>

<p>No more lovely sea exists in the world on which to cruise than that
part of the eastern coast of the Australian continent,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span> sheltered as it is from ocean storms by the Great Barrier Reef,
extending for miles from Rockhampton to Cape York, along the Queensland
coast. Numberless coral islands, the roosting places of countless Torres
Straits pigeons that spend the hours of daylight feeding on the
mainland, afford abundant sport for the gunner. These pigeons are
quick-flying black-and-white birds about the size of the blue rock; they
twist and turn in their flight with great rapidity, and tax the gunner's
quickness of eye and hand not less than the best blue rocks from the
pigeon-cotes of Mr. Hammond. Unfortunately this long stretch of calm
blue water is beset with perils from coral reefs so numerous that the
traveller is lost in admiration at the skill of Captain Cook as well as
at the good fortune which enabled him, in complete ignorance of the
dangers now carefully marked on our charts, to escape with but one
mishap. Among the apt terms which he applied in all his nomenclature
only one, Cape Tribulation, bears witness to the risks which he ran.</p>

<p>Still, an enterprising yachtsman, choosing the time of year when the
monsoon, blowing softly on these confines of its influence, is in the
favourable direction, may start from any of the ports touched by vessels
of the British India Steamship Company, and, by careful study of the
chart coupled with information obtained from local mariners, may enjoy
without great risk a prolonged cruise amid tropical scenery and
vegetation as far south even as Brisbane.</p>

<p>It is to New Zealand, however, that the yachtsman will turn as the
paradise of his sport&mdash;abounding in harbours, offering every variety of
climate from semi-tropical Auckland to the equable temperature of Cook's
Strait, and on to the colder harbours of Stewart's Island&mdash;he will find
as great variety in scenery as in climate. But let him not imagine that
after cruising in Australian waters he may trust himself to the tender
mercies of the Tasman Sea, or cross to New Zealand in a small yacht. No
more terrible sea exists in either hemisphere.</p>

<p>Once arrived in the harbour of Auckland, however, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>(p. 289)</span>
potentialities which lie before the amateur navigator are boundless. As
he passes down the coast from the lighthouse on Cape Maria van Diemen,
he will see the entrance to the singular harbour of Whangaroa, where
masses of limestone rock lay piled one above another, dominated by the
cupola-shaped dome of Mount St. Paul. Either this or the historically
more interesting Bay of Islands may be visited in a yacht from Auckland.
The Bay of Islands is one of the most beautiful yachting bays in the
colony. It has a width of ten miles at the entrance, and is divided in
two by a peninsula, while, with the exception of the Onslow Pinnacle
rock, which has 19 feet on it at low water, it is devoid of all dangers.
Here is the scene of the earliest settlement of the colony. In this bay
the fleets of whalers, who trafficked in dried and tattooed human heads,
and who had dealings of all kinds with the Maories (not always the most
reputable), conducted a lucrative business, which has now ceased
entirely.</p>

<p>Here the first missionaries established themselves, and here was signed
the treaty with the natives which brought the islands under the
sovereignty of the Queen, a sovereignty which was not to remain
undisputed, save after many bloody contests, and after a loss of life
and treasure which still burdens the New Zealander with a load of war
taxation, happily not imposed on his neighbour of the Australian
continent. In this bay many days may profitably be spent in studying the
interesting Maori tribes who dwell on its shores, and of whom none have
stood more loyally by the English settlers than those who fought under
Tamati Waka Nene. Every sort of provision may be obtained in the bay
from the once flourishing town of Russell, while a sufficiently good
cheap coal may be procured at Opua.</p>

<p>It is around the harbour of Auckland, in the Hauraki Gulf, and the Firth
of Thames, however, that the perfection of yachting may be enjoyed. As
the traveller approaches the earlier capital of New Zealand he will
observe how the aptly named Great and Little Barrier Islands protect
the Gulf from the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span> heavy seas of the Pacific, and as the steamer
wends its way through the islands that dot the Gulf and opens up the
land-locked Firth of Thames on one side and the Waitemata Harbour on the
other, he will realise the advantages afforded by the situation of
Auckland.</p>

<p>Two comfortable and well-managed clubs exercise the proverbial
hospitality of colonists to properly accredited arrivals from England.
In addition to which the Auckland Yacht Club is an association from
which all information as to both cruising and racing will readily be
obtained.</p>

<p>The history of yachting in New Zealand is of but recent date; for,
although for many years races have taken place and regattas been held
annually, the competitors were rather the cutters, schooners, and scows
that did the coasting trade of the colony before the Union Steamship
Company inaugurated their line of well-found, fast and regular coasting
steamers to and from every port of New Zealand. These were assisted by
the boats and crews of Her Majesty's ships, whose presence was, and
still is, ardently in request on Regatta days. The era of pleasure
yachts dates from the last eight or ten years, and the Auckland Yacht
Club now occupies, in the number of yachts belonging to the squadron,
the first place among the Australasian Colonies. The club has one
hundred members and the register of yachts exceeds sixty, which does not
by any means exhaust the number of vessels used solely as pleasure-boats
in the harbour.</p>

<p>Colonial yachts, like the great majority of colonial incomes, are not
large, and nearly all the boats used are built locally. Shipbuilding is
a trade extensively carried on at Auckland. During the year 1875, when
the prosperity of that part of the colony was at its highest, not less
than forty vessels were built, their aggregate tonnage being 1,930. A
few steam yachts, such as the 'Sunbeam,' the 'St. George,' and the
R.Y.S. schooner 'Blanche' with auxiliary screw, used by Sir James
Fergusson when Governor of the colony, have cruised in New Zealand
waters; but a vessel of 20 tons burden is considered <span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span> among the
Tritons of colonial pleasure craft. The 'Thetis,' a small yacht of 10 or
12 tons, was built on the Clyde, and was brought out by five gentlemen,
her owners, to the Antipodes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting yacht now sailing in New Zealand waters is
the 'Mascotte,' both on account of the circumstances under which she was
built, as well as for the remarkable success which has attended her
during her sailing career.</p>

<p>In the year 1890 a strike in the shipping trade broke out in Australia,
and after a few days was extended to other trades connected with
shipping, finally spreading to New Zealand. During the enforced idleness
of certain shipbuilding hands at Lyttelton, the port of Christchurch,
some of the men bethought themselves of laying down the lines of a yacht
for themselves. The 'Mascotte,' commenced under these circumstances, was
found, when finished, to be an exceptionally fast sailer. Within
eighteen months of her completion she was manned and sailed by her
owners in six regattas, netting for them 395<i>l.</i>, besides numerous
smaller prizes in club races&mdash;not a bad outcome of work which, at the
time, was doubtless done with no little amount of grumbling, because no
wages were coming in weekly on account of it. The result, however, has
been a very considerable falling off in the entries for the races last
year. For the Champion Cup at Lyttelton only the 'Tarifa,' rated 8, the
'Mima,' 10, and the 'Maritana,' 14, put in an appearance. The First
Class Championship race for 100<i>l.</i> at Wellington, the capital, was
among those secured by the 'Mascotte.'</p>

<p>It is, however, in the cruising opportunities to be found in New Zealand
that readers of the Badminton Library will be chiefly interested. Taking
Auckland as headquarters, it may safely be asserted that throughout the
season the yachtsman may lie in a different creek, harbour, or estuary
every night that he is out.</p>

<p>He may coast up the north shore till he reaches Waiwera, where he will
find an excellent hotel. He can bathe in a large <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span> and luxurious
hot swimming bath, formed from the thermal springs rising close to the
sea, or he may go on to the beautiful island of Kawau, once the property
of Sir George Grey, which has been so graphically described by Mr.
Froude in 'Oceana.' He may lie in the harbour of Bon Accord, which
indents the island a mile and a half, and affords shelter in all
weathers.</p>

<p>On landing he will find planted by the erstwhile owner of Kawau every
sort of tree, shrub, and rare plant that will live either at Madeira or
the Cape.</p>

<p>He will see the wallaby from Australia, deer, sheep, and wild goats. The
beautiful Pohutukawa, or Christmas-tree, covered at Christmas-tide with
scarlet blossom, feathering down to the clear blue sea till its lowest
branches are covered by the rising tide, so that oysters cluster on them
with all the appearance of being the natural fruit. In the rocky depths
of the clear water great lazy stingarees may be seen floating along with
the tide, like sheets of brown paper flapping idly from side to side in
the tide race. A perfectly appointed English country gentleman's house
fronts the harbour. Its lawn and park-like slopes are timbered with the
forest trees of Europe. The opossum of Australia may be seen nimbly
springing from the boughs of an English oak to those of the silver tree
of South Africa, the whole being a combination of the flora and fauna of
all continents, bewildering to the brain of the naturalist.</p>

<p>As the total population of the island is thirty-two, and consists of the
family and dependents of the owner, visitors, unless they wish to run
the risk of abusing hospitality which is always cordially accorded, must
bring a sufficiency of provisions with them.</p>

<p>The Little Barrier Island, though possessing no harbour, has several
yachting anchorages. It is uninhabited, and is chiefly interesting from
the fact that it is the last remaining stronghold of many rare species
of New Zealand birds. This is attributable in some degree to its
distance from the mainland. The bee has not found its way across to
Little Barrier, and the honey-eating birds, driven away from elsewhere
by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>(p. 293)</span> stings of bees seeking a common food, have made this
island their last habitat. It is greatly to be hoped that the New
Zealand Government will complete the pending negotiations for its
purchase from the natives, so that it may be made into a national park
for the preservation of these unique ornithological specimens.</p>

<p>Great Barrier Island is larger than the Isle of Wight, being 21 miles
long. It is about eight miles eastward of the Little Barrier, and
possesses in Port Fitzroy one of the finest harbours in New Zealand.
Yachts enter by a channel 1&frac14; mile wide, pass under a remarkable rock
resembling the Duke of Wellington's head, and come to Governor's Pass, a
narrow channel, 178 feet across, which opens out into an inner harbour
three miles in length and more than half a mile wide, surrounded on all
sides by high mountains which give complete security from every wind.
The harbour is full of fish of every kind, from the little New Zealand
herring to the flat stingaree resembling an enormous skate with a
formidable spiked tail. Unless the fisherman cuts this off before he
proceeds to deal with the fish, he may find one blow from it compel him
to seek for several weeks an asylum in the Auckland Hospital. If the
yachtsman has on board a seine net, he may realise something of the
miraculous draught of fishes mentioned in the Bible. Let him also bring
his rifle, for the island is swarming with wild goats, and if he can
steel his heart against the piercing and humanlike screams to which they
give utterance when wounded, he may, by getting up to the highest ground
and stalking them down the mountain-sides, secure more than he will find
it possible to get back to his yacht, be he never so impervious to
powerful odours. He will, moreover, earn the gratitude of the settlers
by so doing, for the goats eat not a little of that pasture which would
more profitably be utilised in affording sustenance to the domestic
sheep of the island farmers.</p>

<p>Many years ago Selwyn Island, at the entrance to the harbour, was
stocked with the large silver-grey rabbit, and a good day's shooting
may still be had among them, though the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span> skins are no longer of
the great value they were when first acclimatised.</p>

<p>Having explored the creeks of the Waitemata, which open into the harbour
of Auckland to the north, the yachtsman may proceed to cruise in the
southern waters of the Hauraki Gulf. On his way he may run in for a few
hours to one of the Maori villages, where he will find some very
well-to-do natives, owners of valuable property close to Auckland, but
who still practise all the old-fashioned Maori customs of cooking and
manufacture. He will be interested, too, in the long war canoe with its
carved prow, one of the few now remaining in New Zealand.</p>

<p>All the islands between the mouth of the gulf and the Firth of Thames
are interesting. The most remarkable in appearance is Rangitoto,
guarding the entrance to the Auckland harbour. In shape it is a perfect
cone. The mountain is an extinct volcano, rising to a height of 920
feet, and presents a precisely similar appearance from whatever aspect
it is regarded. The summit of the mountain is composed of masses of
scoria, but there is no fresh water on the island. Rangitoto is
connected by a sandy neck, a quarter of a mile long, dry at high water,
with Motu Tapu, the Sacred Island. Whatever odour of sanctity may have
attached to it in earlier days, it is now the island most profaned by
the feet of Auckland yachtsmen. Herds of deer scamper across its grassy
slopes, and afford excellent stalking to the hospitable owner and his
guests. No one who takes care to keep on the shores of the island and
refrain from disturbing the deer is likely to be forbidden to shoot a
few rabbits. From some of the higher points round the coast he may espy
the acclimatised emus stalking over the hills; the pheasants feeding
round the edges of the patches of woodland, and the flocks of turkeys,
once tame, but which now require the persuasion of the fowling-piece
before they can be brought to table.</p>

<p>From the Thames the yacht may be taken round to the harbour of
Tauranga; this is a quiet and comfortable little <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>(p. 295)</span> town, the
harbour land-locked by an island running down to meet a sandy spit. From
this spit rises the Mawayanui Rock, 860 ft. in height, conspicuous for
miles, both from the land and sea sides of the harbour.</p>

<p>The entrance is tortuous, narrow in places, and liable to gusts and
eddies when the wind is blowing from the sea, but of considerable
capacity inside. Tauranga is close to the scene of a conflict between
the Maories and English troops, in which the 68th Regiment lost more
officers than did any regiment at Waterloo. It is the best harbour
whence to visit the volcano of White Island, and is the nearest also to
the Maori Settlements, the hot lakes and springs of the interior of the
North Island.</p>

<p>White Island is sixty miles off, and the steam blowing off the crater to
a height varying from 2,000 to 10,000 feet is clearly visible in fine
weather. This island is well worth a visit, though great care must be
exercised in landing, for the whole island is so hot that walking is not
pleasant, while the clouds of sulphurous steam blowing to leeward are
suffocating. It is about three miles in circumference, having in the
centre a crater about a hundred yards in circumference, surrounded by
steam geysers, which make a roaring, deafening noise, like a hundred
engines massed in one engine-room. Although there is no vegetation on
the island, the base of the crater gives the appearance of a
well-watered meadow in spring. This effect is produced by the bed of
crystallised sulphur traversed by the streams from the several geysers.
Myriads of sea birds, chiefly gannets, circle round the island, and the
remarkable Tuatara lizards may be seen crawling on the hot rocks. There
is no harbour in the island, but there is shelter between the principal
islet and a little islet half a mile to south-east.</p>

<p>Yachting on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand is less
agreeable; there is no convenient centre from which to start on many
cruises, and between the harbours are long distances of usually stormy
sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span> Once inside the Kaipara Harbour a large expanse of rather
uninteresting water is available, but the rivers which flow into it are
wide and picturesque, afford excellent wildfowl shooting, and are the
home of the trade in Kauri timber. The huge logs are cut up by sawmills
with giant circular saws. The trunks of the Kauri trees may be seen
floating down the rivers from the forests above till they are caught, as
they pass the various mills, by baulks stretched at an angle across the
stream to intercept their progress. In the same way, once you get across
the bar of the Hokianga River, many days may be spent in the land of
oranges and lemons.</p>

<p>Travelling to the southern end of the North Island to the harbour of
Port Nicholson, we come to Wellington, the capital, where the Port
Nicholson Yacht Club have their headquarters.</p>

<p>An annual regatta is held here in January. The harbour, though
magnificent for steamers or vessels of large tonnage, is subject to the
gales and sudden squalls which blow through Cook's Strait as through a
blast pipe, and therefore not always to be trusted. Not a few sad
accidents have happened to small craft sailing on the waters of the
harbour.</p>

<p>Most enjoyable excursions may be made from Wellington to the sounds on
the northern shores of the South Island, but great care should be
exercised in crossing Cook's Strait, though the distance to the first
sound is but a few miles. The winds are local, and almost invariably
north-west or south-east. Yachts running through the Straits should,
therefore, be on the look out for a rapid change from the south-east to
north-east, or from north-west to south-west, as they open out either
entrance. Queen Charlotte and the Pelorus are the most picturesque of
these sounds. They resemble somewhat the fiords of Norway, and though
they have not the grandeur of the sounds on the west coast of this
island, they are remarkable for the soft green contour of their slopes
and the striking contrast between sky, shore, and sea which they present
in clear weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span> Picton, at the head of Queen Charlotte Sound, is picturesquely
situated, with a good wharf. Like those in the south, the sounds are so
deep (20 to 25 fathoms) that, except in the coves, of which,
fortunately, there is no lack, vessels have difficulty in finding an
anchorage. Like the harbour of Wellington across the strait, these
sounds are liable to many gusts from the mountain gullies, and care
should be exercised whenever it is known to be blowing hard outside.</p>

<p>Pelorus Sound has even more coves and bays than Queen Charlotte Sound,
and no inconsiderable time is necessary to explore the whole of it.</p>

<p>There is abundance of both wood and fresh water; in every part excellent
fishing with the line may be had. Most of the catch will be new to
English fishermen. Rock cod, blue cod, schnapper, the giant hapuka, a
sort of cod, and the game kahawai, which will run like a salmon, are the
best from a gastronomical and sporting point of view. Enough has been
caught by a single line in a day to feed the whole crew of a man-of-war.
Every sort of necessary provision is obtainable both at Havelock and
Picton, at the heads of the respective sounds.</p>

<p>From the northern sounds every traveller will wish to proceed through
the remarkable French pass to Nelson in Blind Bay. This bay is
singularly free from gales and storms. Often, while a hurricane is
tearing and raging through Cook's Strait, calm weather will be found to
prevail without disturbance in Blind Bay.</p>

<p>The harbour of Nelson is formed by a very remarkable bank 4&frac12; miles in
length, covered with huge boulders and forming a natural breakwater to
the harbour. There are one or two gaps in the bank at high water where
boats and very small vessels may pass over, but the tide runs with such
force that it is not advisable to attempt it.</p>

<p>The entrance is not more than 50 yards wide, and lies between the bold
pinnacle of the Arrow Rock and the barrel beacon at the edge of the
Boulder Bank. The entrance is easily effected on the flood, but the
tides run very strong in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>(p. 298)</span> and out of the narrow entrance. The
climate of Nelson is perhaps the most perfect in all New Zealand, and
the scenery of the bay, with its blue waters and background of
snow-covered mountains in winter and early spring, excels anything that
can be seen on the Riviera, while the climate closely resembles that of
the French littoral of the Mediterranean; the only unpleasantness being
the Waimea wind, felt in early spring down the valley of the Waimea, but
it is neither so continuous nor so unpleasant as the Mistral of the
Riviera.</p>

<p>Very pleasant expeditions may be made to Motueka and Collingwood, on the
opposite shores of the bay. The Californian quail exists in great
abundance on these shores; so much so that the little steamers plying
weekly bring sackloads of the birds to Nelson, where they are preserved
whole in tins for export.</p>

<p>The yachtsman should spend a sufficient length of time in exploring the
indentations of the northern coast of the South Island, for next to that
of the surroundings of Auckland he is likely to meet with the best
weather for his pursuits to be found in New Zealand.</p>

<p>If he then wishes completely to exhaust the opportunities which the
colony affords him, he may, choosing a fine day and favourable
barometric indications, venture on the ocean to the southward. Let him,
however, avoid the west coast, where the harbours are few and far
between, and where those that exist are rendered difficult of access,
save where great expense (as at Westport and Greymouth) has been
incurred by the local authorities to erect breakwaters and dredge the
bars. It is noteworthy that the harbours on the west coast of both
islands, where they are also the estuaries of rivers, have dangerous
shifting sand-bars, while those on the east coast are comparatively free
from this objection.</p>

<p>If the yacht be taken down the east coast to Lyttelton, the traveller
will pass in full view of the grand range of snow-covered mountains, the
Kaikouras. With a north-easterly wind the sea does not get up to any
extent, but if it should <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span> change to south there is convenient
shelter for small craft at Kaikoura.</p>

<p>The harbour of Lyttelton is an indentation of considerable depth and
width in Banks Peninsula, which, rising from the flat plains of
Canterbury to a height of some 3,000 feet, juts out into the ocean and
extends twenty miles from the mainland with an average width of sixteen
miles. This peninsula affords plenty of facilities for yachting.
Lyttelton has a yacht club, and is connected by eight miles of railway
with Christchurch, a town that has always borne the reputation of
resembling those of the old country more closely than any other in New
Zealand.</p>

<p>Inside the harbour are many pleasant anchorages for yachts, especially
Quail Island and Ripa Island; also Governor's Bay, a favourite holiday
resort of the people of Christchurch. It should be borne in mind that
with a north-easterly wind a heavy swell comes rolling up the harbour,
but a secure inner harbour of 107 acres has been formed by moles of
rubble, where there is perfect safely for vessels of every kind.</p>

<p>There are many pleasant cruises to be made from Lyttelton to the various
bays and harbours in the peninsula, such as to Port Leny and to Pigeon
Bay, formerly a favourite station for whaling vessels; but the most
interesting as well as the most beautiful is the harbour of the old
French settlement of Akaroa. This harbour penetrates the peninsula to a
distance of eight miles. The town of Akaroa is the centre of a fine
pastoral district, most picturesquely situated on the slopes of green
hills turned into fertile gardens. The French language is no longer to
be heard in the streets, but the green 'persiennes' and the white fronts
of the older houses bear witness to the nationality of their builders.
Lucky it was for the Anglo-New Zealander of to-day that Captain Hobson,
Lieutenant-Governor at Auckland in 1840, was both of hospitable intent
and impressed with the necessity of 'pegging out claims' for the future
of the English race. Lucky, too, that Captain Lavand, on his way to
prepare for a shipload of French colonists, stayed to enjoy Captain
Hobson's hospitality in Auckland, while the latter, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> having
ascertained his guest's intentions, had time to despatch H.M.'s brig
'Britomart' with all possible speed to Akaroa, so that when the gallant
Frenchman arrived he found the smart sailors of the 'Britomart' sitting
at the foot of a recently erected flagstaff admiring a Union Jack flying
from the top; by virtue of which they claimed the South Island of New
Zealand for Queen Victoria in the same manner as Captain Hobson had
recently done in the case of the North Island. These same French
emigrants, stopping at St. Helena on their way out, visited the tomb of
Napoleon, and piously preserved sprays cut from the weeping willows that
surrounded it. From these sprays, planted and cherished on their arrival
at Akaroa, sprang all the beautiful willows which grow with such
rapidity, thrive so remarkably, and are so conspicuous a feature
throughout New Zealand. In December of every year a regatta is held at
Akaroa, and yachts from all parts of New Zealand, as well as boats'
crews of one of H.M.'s ships, come to take part in it.</p>

<p>The yachting grounds proper of New Zealand may be said to be completed
by the exploration of the peninsula below Christchurch, and yet the most
remarkable waters of the colony remain unvisited.</p>

<p>These are the sounds of the south-western extremity of the island. To
get to them, however, many miles of open ocean must be sailed over.
Rarely does the wind blow from the east, and hard threshing against the
wind is the usual condition of sailing from the 'Bluff' to the sounds.
When they are reached, the giant mountains which hedge them in on every
side shut out from some, for days and weeks together, the least puff of
wind to fill the sails of the yacht; while the deep gullies running down
the sides of the mountains in others admit sudden and violent gusts of
wind full of danger to the small sailing craft.</p>

<p>There are interesting places to be visited on the way, such as the
harbours of Timaru and Oamaru, where man at vast labour and expense has
wrested from the violence of the ocean a small space of calm water in
the long straight coast <span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span> line, well named the Ninety-mile Beach,
on which the rollers break and roar with ceaseless monotony; or the
beautiful harbour of Port Chalmers, leading to Dunedin, the Scotch
capital of Otago. The uninviting looking harbour of the Bluff, where the
traveller may touch the most southerly lamppost in the world, lies
opposite to Stewart's Island, and is separated from it by Foveaux
Strait, one of the most extensive oyster beds in the world. There are
several fine harbours in Stewart Island, especially the spacious port of
Paterson's Inlet, full of coves and bays.</p>

<p>Yachts bent on visiting the sounds should be warned that a strong
current consequent on the quantity of water pouring down from the
mountain torrents is usually found to oppose the entrance of a yacht
into each sound, and that it is very rarely that the wind blows strong
enough to bring yachts in. Generally speaking, within a mile of the
entrance a dead calm with heavy swell will be found, rendering it both
difficult and dangerous to make the entrance.</p>

<p>Once inside the depth is so great that, except where a river runs in at
the head, there is little chance of anchorage, and the vessel must be
made fast by tying her to a tree.</p>

<p>There is land communication with one sound (Milford) alone, and that
only by a foot track. One or two men manage to eke out a hermit's
existence in certain of the sounds, but are chiefly dependent on the
periodical visits of the Government steamer; otherwise the only living
things on the land are the wingless kiwis and kakapos, and an occasional
seal lying upon the rocks. Probably no one visiting New Zealand will
care to omit a trip to these sounds; but let the yachtsman leave his
vessel snugly berthed in the harbour of Lyttelton or Port Chalmers, and
pin his faith to the screws of the Union Steamship Company's well-found
vessels, rather than to the sails of his own craft.</p>

<p>For a yachting expedition to New Zealand the month of January, February,
March, or April should be chosen. During these months in the northern
parts of the colony and on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> coast a N.E. sea breeze sets in
daily about ten in the morning, and dying away at sunset is succeeded by
a westerly or land wind. The yachtsman may generally reckon on these
winds; but if the land wind should not set in towards evening the sea
breeze may increase to a gale, when he can remain safe at his anchorage
till it has blown itself out&mdash;a proceeding which generally occupies not
more than twenty-four hours. These gales occur on an average but once in
six weeks, and should be looked for when the moon changes or comes to
the full.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the winds of Cook's Strait; those likely to be
met with between it and Banks Peninsula will be chiefly north-easterly
and light in summer. Southerly and south-easterly gales, known as
'southerly busters,' often last three days, and bring cold rain and
dirty weather. Very strong, hot north-westers blow across the Canterbury
plains to Banks Peninsula, and are particularly drying and unpleasant.
Their approach can generally be foretold by a remarkable clearness of
the atmosphere, and an arch of cloud over the Southern Alps, showing
blue sky between the cloud and the snow peaks.</p>

<p>The climate in the central and southern parts of the colony is
remarkably like that of Great Britain, with more wind and more sunshine,
while the northern part resembles that of the shores of Europe washed by
the Mediterranean. Indeed, if one takes the map of New Zealand and turns
it upside down, imagining the two islands joined together at Cook's
Strait, its general similarity in outline and configuration to Italy
will at once become apparent. The Southern Alps, the Spencer Mountains,
and the Ruahine Mountains, like the Alps and Apennines in Italy, form
the head and backbone of the country. The rich plains of Otago and
Canterbury answer to those of Lombardy and the Campagna, while the palms
and fern-trees of Auckland wave against a sky as blue as that of Naples.</p>

<p>The coast is more indented, the harbours more spacious than those of the
Mediterranean; the islands in the north are more numerous, and though
the winds blow stronger and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>(p. 303)</span> sea runs higher when gales come
on, the weather is far less treacherous than that of the Mediterranean,
and gives better warning of its approach. For those who wish to enjoy
two summers without a winter, to see some of the most remarkable natural
phenomena of the world, and the most interesting and most developed
savage race with which Englishmen have come in contact; to explore fresh
waters; to find an ample supply of good provisions, suited to European
requirements; to live among fellow-countrymen who will assuredly give a
hearty and hospitable welcome, and to realise something of the extent,
the variety and the vastness of the Queen's Empire, I can suggest no
better nor more enjoyable cruise during the English winter months than
one round the beautiful islands of Antipodean Britain.</p>

</div>

<p>The year 1891 will be memorable in the history of French yachting as the
date of the beginning of a thorough organisation for the encouragement
of what in France is called 'navigation de plaisir,' a term which will
soon contract to our simpler word 'yachting.' The French have long,
however, had a taste for the sport. For half a century at least Havre
has been <i lang="fr">en fête</i> in the month of July with a great deal of rowing and
sailing, encouraged by crowds on the quays of the port, whence they
could enjoy the sport much more than if they were afloat. All this is
due to the energy and encouragement of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>(p. 306)</span> the Société des Régates
au Havre, under the patronage of the Minister of Marine and the City of
Havre.</p>

</div>

<p>In the year 1891 the regatta was first conducted in a business-like
manner. A yachting tribunal was instituted in Paris to make rules and
arrange the details of racing. The society, styled 'Union des Yachts
Français,' 45 Rue Boissy d'Anglas, Paris, was very heartily taken up by
all the best men in France, and absorbed the other clubs. The President
is Contre-Amiral Baron Lagé; Vice-Presidents, M. E. Pérignon, Baron
Arthur de Rothschild, Comte Alain de Guébriant, and M. Henri Menier,
with a Council of twenty-eight, and a tremendous administration of
commissions or committees for everything. The list of members amounts to
520, and their yacht list comprises over 300 vessels of sorts and sizes.</p>

<p>After Havre, Nice ranks as a French yachting centre. The regatta is
always held about the 12th to 15th of March&mdash;a time of the year when we
are generally experiencing a kind of weather which totally removes any
idea of yachting from our minds. The Union des Yachts Français patronise
this <i lang="fr">fête nautique</i>, which is sometimes assisted by English yachts that
are in the Mediterranean; for instance, Lord Dunraven's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>(p. 308)</span>
'Valkyrie' has been amongst them, and Lieut. W. Henn's 'Galatea,' he
being a member of the Club Nautique, 8 Quai Masséna, Nice, a club
founded in 1883, with rather more than one hundred members. At the
present time several English gentlemen belong to it. Their 'Siège' is
No. 12 Rue St. François de Paula à Nice. These foreign yacht races do
not offer any inducements to our finer and larger craft, as few of the
competitors are over 20 tons. The City of Nice gives good prizes, as

<p>The courses are very short&mdash;about 11&frac12; miles in the triangle once
round; and in the race from Nice to the flagboat off Monaco the course
there and back is only about 19 miles. The whole arrangements are
carried out according to the rules and regulations of the U.Y.F., which
have given great satisfaction at Nice as well as at Havre.</p>

<p>It was at Nice that the idea of a race for steam yachts was first
carried out. Two vessels entered, and only two; and as the 2nd prize and
medal was 120<i>l.</i>, they both had something to try for. The two were the
'Eros,' 850 tons, Baron A. Rothschild, and 'Francisca.' The 'Eros' won
the first prize, 600<i>l.</i> and medal.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>(p. 309)</span> GERMANY</h3>

<p>His Majesty the Emperor William having bought the English yacht
'Thistle,' 170 tons, and Prince Henry of Prussia having built a new
40-rater, the 'Irene,' designed by G. L. Watson (as also a small rater,
the 'Niny,' from Arthur E. Payne), the idea of an Imperial German Yacht
Club naturally arose, and in 1891 one was established at Kiel, a place
admirably adapted for the purpose. The whole matter was taken up so
heartily along the coast that there are at the present time more than
550 members belonging to the club. Of course the number of yachts is not
in proportion as yet, but this will gradually develope, and in the
meantime it is very pleasant to know that the 'Thistle' has become the
mother of such a club.</p>

<h3>SWEDEN</h3>

<p>The Swedish Club, established 1832, is very strong, having five yachting
stations&mdash;Stockholm, Goteborg, Norrköping, Malmö, and Ornskoldsirk&mdash;the
members owning vessels of good tonnage, schooners, screw steamers,
cutters and yawls, numbering over 170.</p>

<h3>CANADA<br>
<span class="smcap">By G. L. Blake</span></h3>

<p>Yachting in Canada dates back as a pastime almost to the first days of
its colonisation. Halifax, Toronto, and Quebec can boast of yacht clubs
which were formed long before the seventies, one of the oldest, if not
the oldest, being the Royal Canadian Yacht Club at Toronto, which was
started as far back as the year 1852, and now has a fleet of forty
yachts and more. On Lake Ontario, a superb sheet of water some 200 miles
long by 40 in breadth, with a depth in places of over 100 fathoms, and
well adapted for either cruising or racing, the sport has been
cultivated as a science <span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>(p. 310)</span> for many years, so much so in fact
that, in 1873, a leading authority on such matters wrote, 'Yachting is
fast becoming the national pastime of Canada.'</p>

<p>In 1872 there were yachting stations at Toronto, Coburg, Kingston,
Hamilton,&mdash;the club at Hamilton was made a Royal Club in
1888&mdash;Belleville, and other ports on the confines of the Lake, where
numerous regattas have been held each season; but, as the prosperity of
colonial yachting entirely depends on the state of trade, these small
communities have seen many ups and downs. During Lord Dufferin's tenure
of office as Governor of Canada a great impetus was given to things
maritime, and the author of 'Letters from High Latitudes,' who owned and
sailed a small 7-tonner at the time, lent a very able helping hand to
all that concerned yachting in Canadian waters. Yachts of all
descriptions are to be found there, from the small skimdish of a
'sharpie,' with its enormous centreboard and cloud of canvas, to the
stately schooner of 200 tons and over. In 1872 there were only one or
two vessels of English design or build on Ontario (which is practically
the chief yachting centre), of which the best known was the little
'Rivet,' 17 tons, that had been built at Glasgow and was brought out in
frame some years before. At the present time, however, anyone visiting
Ontario would see many old Scotch and English favourites cruising about;
more than one of our smartest 10- and 5-tonners are now registered on
Canadian books, while most of our principal yacht designers have
representatives of their skill flying racing flags and built to the
Canadian tonnage rule.</p>

<p>As there is communication with the ocean by canal and river <i lang="la">viâ</i>
Montreal, Quebec and the St. Lawrence, besides through canal with New
York, yachts from outports are not infrequent visitors, and they take
part from time to time in the several local regattas. The lake, as might
be expected, is often troubled by severe squalls, which now and then, if
of long continuance, create a very heavy sea disturbance. Luckily, this
does not occur very often, though moderately greasy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>(p. 311)</span> weather
sometimes has its advantages in giving tone and colour to the enjoyments
of open sea navigation.</p>

<p>Of the principal Canadian outports, Halifax and Quebec are the oldest
and most sporting. The Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Club, which was
established in 1875, and is stationed at Halifax, is one of the leading
clubs in the Dominion; that at Quebec dates back over twenty years; and
the St. Lawrence Club, at Montreal, with its fleet of eighty yachts,
some five years. At Halifax there used to be a very sporting club,
called the Royal Halifax Yacht Club, which would hold precedence of the
R.N.S.Y.C., as one of the oldest societies of the kind in Canada, did it
exist as such, but it is believed to have been blended into the latter
club and to have assumed its new name.</p>

<p>Canada is rich in all the necessaries that are called into play in ship-
and yacht-building, the woods she provides for the purpose being some of
the finest in the world. Nothing can come up to her timbers, such as the
spruce, yellow and red pine varieties, either for length, evenness of
grain, or freedom from knots, and it is to Canada that we in England are
so deeply indebted for most of the timber used in our shipbuilding
yards.</p>

<h3>AUSTRALIA</h3>

<p>In Australia yachting has had, and in some places still has, a hard
fight to assert itself against the exciting sport of horse-racing. The
oldest yachting community is that stationed at Sydney, New South Wales,
where the two leading clubs date back to the years 1863 and 1867, viz.
the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, and the Prince Alfred Yacht Club.
Yacht-racing, however, was carried on long before those years, and
perhaps owing to the fine piece of water, some twelve square miles in
area, enclosed within Port Jackson Heads, which lends itself to aquatic
pursuits, yachting here has taken greater hold of the inhabitants than
at any other place in the Southern Ocean. No finer boat sailers exist
anywhere than at Sydney. There are a goodly number of yachts connected
with the Port, and no money <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>(p. 312)</span> or care has been spared to keep the
Sydney fleet up to date. Both Messrs. G. L. Watson and W. Fife, jun., to
say nothing of other well-known designers, have from time to time given
a helping hand towards furthering this end. The classes, however, which
give the most sport, and which can draw together 5,000 or more onlookers
during a racing day, are those that include the open boats. These are
altogether a speciality of Sydney.</p>

<p>The limits of the three principal classes are&mdash;for the</p>

<p>First Class.&mdash;24 ft. length, with not less than 7 ft. beam, and 3 ft.
depth.</p>

<p>Second Class.&mdash;19 ft. length, with not less than 6.5 ft. beam, and 30
in. depth.</p>

<p>Third Class.&mdash;17 ft. length, with not less than 5 ft. beam, and 20 in.
depth.</p>

<p>These boats are all centreboarders. When in Australia the writer was
shown the 'Victor' as the finest example at that time of the large
class. She was 34 ft. long, had 8 ft. beam, and a depth of 3 ft. A
description of her was given in 'Hunt's Yachting Magazine' some years
ago. She was built of colonial cedar, and of &frac12;-in. planking. Her
frames were of bent elm, the sternpost and knees of tea-tree, while her
keel was of tallow-wood. Her draught aft was 21 in., and forward 2 in.,
with the crew of sixteen men on board. She carried a racing centreboard
of &frac14;-inch plating, 9 ft. long, and 6 ft. deep, with a double drop,
allowing the plate when lowered to hang with its length horizontal to
the keel. For ordinary occasions the racing centreboard was unshipped,
and a smaller one substituted in its place. No dead ballast is allowed
in these boats, and two air-tight or cork cushions are carried under the
thwarts, because no boat is permitted to start for a race unless she
possesses sufficient buoyancy to keep afloat should she happen to turn
turtle or capsize. The 'Victor' was fitted, like all the boats of her
class, with stringers running fore and aft, about two feet from the
gunwale, which allowed the crew to sit double-banked, the outside
contingent on the weather <span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>(p. 313)</span> gunwale, with their feet under the
stringer, the inside on the stringer itself. When shifting from the
starboard to the port tack, or <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, both outside and inside men
go over at the same time, the inside men becoming outside, and the
outside of the previous tack becoming inside. The 'Mantura' and
'Craigielee' are also fine specimens of the 24-feet class. Photographs
of these two boats under way are hung in the billiard-room of the Royal
Clyde Yacht Club House.</p>

<p>The wood these boats are planked with is fine, hard, durable stuff; and
lends itself, when finished off, to the formation of a beautifully
smooth surface, which readily takes a good polish. This colonial cedar
is used for deck-fittings, &amp;c., and takes the place of mahogany with us.
New South Wales is certainly very bountiful to yacht-builders in its
supply of timber for all purposes connected with their trade, though New
Zealand has to supply the pine-wood for yachts' decks. For floors three
native woods are employed&mdash;honeysuckle, white mahogany, and
tea-tree&mdash;while iron bark, so well known for its value in the building
of whalers, is excellent for knees and suchlike. All these woods offer
strong, naturally grown shapes, and forks of the most acute angles.
Spotted gum is generally employed for bent timbers; another wood is
found in the tallow-tree, which is very suitable for keels, owing to its
hard yet oily nature.</p>

<p>From its position the harbour suffers from uncertain winds, but should
there be a clear sky and a hard north-easter there need be no fear that
the racing will not prove of the very best. The regatta course forms an
obtuse-angled triangle, and as a short stretch has to be taken across
the mouth of the harbour, it not infrequently happens that a very
uncomfortable sea has to be negotiated before the second buoy can be
rounded for the run home.</p>

<p>Hobson's Bay is a much larger tract of water, being close upon ninety
miles in circumference. It is not, however, navigable in all parts owing
to extensive shoals. These, though very much in the way of navigation,
help to form a kind of breakwater to the anchorages off Sandridge and
Williamstown, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>(p. 314)</span> which are open to southerly and south-westerly
winds, and would accordingly, but for them, be often swept by very heavy
seas. The principal yacht club is the Royal Yacht Club of Victoria,
established at Melbourne; but there are numerous small yacht and boat
clubs scattered about the colony at various towns, such as Sandhurst,
Bendigo and Ballarat, where there are lagoons or lakes varying in size
from three to many miles in circumference. The Albert Park Yacht Club,
at Melbourne, is a good type of one of these inland institutions. The
yachts or boats employed on the Albert and Ballarat lagoons range from
14 feet to 30 feet over all, They have great beam, and because the depth
of water is as a rule shallow, have rarely over 4 feet to 5 feet
draught. Good sport is obtained out of them, and races are continually
taking place.</p>

<p>At Geelong, which is a fine natural harbour about forty miles from
Melbourne, and off the open anchorages of St. Kilda and Brighton, yachts
are moored during the season, and at these places are to be found any
number of yachting enthusiasts.</p>

<p>The club course is a very good one for trying the respective merits of
competing yachts, and many an exciting race has been sailed over it.
Intercolonial regattas have been held, which have proved great
successes, and for these, owners of yachts of 40 tons and under think
nothing of working their way from port to port over an expanse of a
thousand miles or so of ocean. The yachts built in the colony are framed
and planked with the wood of the red gum-tree, which is, in fact, the
only wood the colony produces that is of any real value for the
yacht-builder's use. It takes the place of larch or pitch-pine with us.</p>

<p>Both Adelaide, in South Australia, and Auckland, in New Zealand, possess
yacht clubs, and are the homes of many keen lovers of yacht racing. The
Royal South Australian Yacht Squadron, at the former place, has been in
existence for almost a quarter of a century. The New Zealand yachtsmen
can boast of possessing in their midst perhaps the finest woods in the
world, and nothing can beat the kauri pine for decks, though in England
and other countries it is generally known <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>(p. 315)</span> only for the
excellent masts and spars that can be got out of it. A Scotch builder
once reported that he found it very apt to twist and warp; but most
likely the wood had been cut badly, for that is not the general opinion
regarding it in the colonies, where it is almost invariably employed for
decks. New Zealand, however, has been treated at length in the preceding
chapter.</p>

<h3>BOMBAY, ETC.</h3>

<p>At Bombay, Malta and Hong Kong regular annual regattas are held, besides
numerous matches and races during the yachting seasons. British built or
designed yachts, to say nothing of those produced by local talent, are
to be met with in all three ports. At Malta and Bombay very flourishing
Royal Yacht Clubs exist.</p>

<a id="img152" name="img152"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img152.jpg" width="400" height="247" alt="" title="">
<p>Lateen yachts, Bombay Club, 1887.</p>
</div>

<p>The yachts at Malta are principally cutter or Bermuda rigged vessels,
and range from 20-tonners downward. The Royal Bombay Yacht Club
possesses a house beautifully <span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>(p. 316)</span> situated near the Apollo Bunda,
or main pier, and the yacht anchorage is within hail of the club lawn.
About two dozen or more yachts make use of it, among them being steamers
and vessels of every method of fore-and-aft rig. Two or three are
British built, and among these is the easily recognised little 3-tonner
'Senta,' so well known in Kingstown during the palmy racing days of the
3-tonner class. One of the latest additions to the fleet is a small
Clyde-built yacht something under 5 tons, with the fashionable
fiddle-headed bow. This boat the writer saw under way. There were a
number of dhows, large enough to carry three or four such yachts
inboard, making up harbour with a fine sailing breeze just a point abaft
the beam, which placed them on one of their best points of sailing. They
appeared to be slipping through the smooth water at a high speed,
leaving it as clean as if it had never been disturbed, and everything
was in their favour for making a quick passage. The little Clyde boat
had been knocking about the harbour and was well astern of the dhows,
when she was hove round and made to stand on after them. Favoured with
the same wind, gradually she began to draw up to them, and bit by bit
overhauled and passed each one, leaving them in a manner which made me
doubt very much whether the rate of speed with which dhows are so often
credited can really be so great. The dhow-rigged racing yachts make very
good reckonings. They have considerable draught forward, with a small
draught aft, and the foremast (the masts rake forward) has its step
almost over where the largest body and the greatest draught happens to
be. These yachts, like all vessels of a similar rig and build, are never
tacked, but are always gybed, and naturally in a triangular course they
lose much time when racing against cutters and schooners.</p>

<h3>BERMUDA<br>
<span class="smcap">By R. T. Pritchett</span></h3>

<p>The Bermudian's hobby is going to windward, and to be really happy he
must have a semicircular fin or plate on his keel like that described by
Lord Pembroke. Bermuda has a Royal Yacht Club which gives prizes and
holds regattas at Hamilton. There is also a Dinghy Club, of which the
Princess Louise is Lady Patroness. Lord and Lady Brassey each presented
a Challenge Cup when they visited Hamilton in 1883 in the 'Sunbeam.' One
class here deserves special notice.</p>

<p>'Fitted Races' are the chief joy of the true Bermudian. The owner
apparently gives up his boat to the fiendish devices of his 'pilot,' as
the nigger boatman is called, who gets the biggest mast, spars and sails
he can find, often a 50-foot mast in a 25-foot boat, and a 35- or
40-foot boom topping up with a huge square-sail as big as a ship's
maintop-gallant-sail. He then collects all the other niggers he can
find, dresses them in striped jerseys and caps, puts them up to
windward, over a ton and a half of shifting ballast, serves out a lot of
rum all round, and off they go, generally with the head of the mainsail
lashed (no halliard) to the masthead, so that she must carry her whole
sail all through the race or swamp. The present writer's experience is
confined to many good dustings in that admirable craft the 'Diamond,'
with her very able skipper Burgess, coloured gentleman (<i lang="fr">bien culotté</i>),
both of which were lent to Lady Brassey by Admiral Sir Edmund Commerell.
She was built of cedar, and her lines and midship section are given in
Dixon Kemp's 'Boat-sailing.'</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Ricardo, Secretary of Upper Thames Sailing Club, who sailed
with the owner of the 'Cara,' a 28-foot boarder, kindly furnishes the
following description of a Fitted Race.</p>

<p>The morning of the race it blew hard, and we sailed out to the leeward
mark-boat half under water, the 'Cara' having only about 14 in.
freeboard, and on board there were six hands, a big spinnaker boom, and
some two dozen so-called sandbags for shifting. These had been
apparently filled with mud, not sand, and as they rapidly got soaked, we
looked more like navvies fresh from a clay-pit than boat sailers. There
are many gradations of dirt and various degrees of saturation from salt
water, but this combination is unapproachable. We caught a line from the
mark-boat and shifted jib, owner going out on the bowsprit for this
function, and getting a couple of green seas well in the small of his
back&mdash;it didn't matter. We were well soaked already, so more or less was
quite immaterial to us. We were hanging on to the stake-boat some time,
waiting for the other craft to arrive, with nothing particular to do but
bale out and try to dodge the things kicking about in the bottom of the
boat. I had no shoes on, and there was one baler. I thought I had put it
into a locker three times, and was watching the wretched thing edge out
again and prepare to fall on my toes, sharp edge down of course, when
the owner sung out lustily, 'Boat bearing down to hang on!' She was a
regular Bermudian with 'fitted' gear, enormous spars, and her big sail
up, a crew of coloured gentlemen crowded up to windward, and foaming
through it like a tugboat after a homeward-bounder. She had to gybe
under our stern and run lip alongside the mark-boat, and&mdash;Swish, over
came the boom again; swish, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321"></a>(p. 321)</span> went the end of it into the water.
She heeled over tremendously, and did not seem to right, as she ought to
have done. We guessed at once what had happened: her ballast was to
leeward&mdash;those mud bags&mdash;it had not been shifted in time as she came
round, and of course kept her on her beam ends; she gradually settled
down and sank in about four minutes. The water was full of yelling
niggers, who mostly swam for us; there seemed to be some hundred of
them&mdash;anyway they yelled like it. They nearly swamped us scrambling in;
finally we got rid of them on to the mark-boat, and very glad we were,
as a few dozen damp niggers all asking at the same time for drinks are
not much fun in a small boat with a bit of a sea on. At the time it was
not enjoyable; still it is an episode in yachting experiences which
grows more pleasant to refer to as it looms astern and becomes ancient
history. When one starts for a day's sport, it is weak to allow a
trifling incident like this to mar the even tenor of its way, and at
Bermuda one dries so soon.</p>

<p>A great deal of dinghy racing is done at St. George's, and it will be
well to notice here the peculiarity of these boats and their gear. The
normal dimensions of the dinghy are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dinghies are fearfully and wonderfully made things, with their plate on
as in the big boats, the sails lashed up and set in. Five lunatics come
next in the prescription; these embark very gingerly indeed&mdash;quite a bit
of fancy work&mdash;while some one holds on to the mast from the top of the
wharf to prevent accident, and when they think they are ready and
balanced they are shoved off. Directly she feels the wind over she goes,
and four hands stretch out to windward as far as possible, the fifth
being busy baling, which is a most important feature of dinghy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>(p. 322)</span>
sailing. A very exciting amusement it is. As long as the boats can be
kept right side up they do go a tremendous pace. Waiting about before
the race and gybing are the most exciting and dangerous times, as three
dinghies have been known to capsize in one race before starting. Bathing
costume is considered the correct thing, and is well adapted to the
climate; it is also desirable in this sport to be able to swim, as there
is no room in the boats for such superfluities as life-belts. The
'Diamond' was a very fine boat, and splendid in a wind; as the mainsail
represents the usual mainsail and jackyarder all in one, the whole
sail-area forms the desirable equilateral triangle a little aft to send
her up to the wind.</p>

<p>The fitting of the boom is different from any other rig, as it passes
on one side beyond the mast; a tail block hauls <span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>(p. 323)</span> the boom right
aft, and counteracted by the mainsheet gives a very flat sail indeed;
great results are obtained, all the advantages of a standing lug on a
large scale being secured, while the tension can be increased and the
canvas made flatter. Space cannot be afforded for her lines, midship
section and sail-plan, good as they are, still 'Diamond' is decidedly a
good cedar-built representative craft:&mdash;</p>

<p>The extravagances of Bermudian water frolics have been given here as
very extreme instances of yachting enjoyments; still Bermuda is a
splendid place for sailing. You can leave the island on a Friday for New
York, arriving on Monday; leave New York on Tuesday, and in a week more
be back in the old country.</p>

<p>'Waterwitch,' 331 tons (Earl of Belfast) and 'Galatea,'
179 tons.<br> The start for a race for 1,000 guineas, September 1, 1834.
</div>

<p>In former days, matches were made between yachts as between horses on
the turf, and the stakes were often heavy, but such events are now
almost unknown; the increase in the number of craft has divided the
attention of the public, and the performance of each vessel is so well
known that there are no dark sea-horses to bring out as a surprise. The
records of bygone matches are, however, far from easy to obtain, if,
indeed, they are obtainable. Newspapers were formerly less numerous than
they are at present, nor did there apparently exist much thirst for
information and minute detail on the part of the public. Accounts
remain, however, of some few of the most important matches. One for a
thousand guineas, August 29, 1771, sailed between the Duke of Richmond
and Sir Alexander Smith, the course being from Brighton to Beachy Head
and back, has been already mentioned, but from this date much search has
yielded scanty results. The war must have interfered greatly with the
sport, for there is a long lapse of time when yachting scarcely came at
all under the notice of the press. The Royal Yacht Squadron's fine class
of schooners and vessels of large tonnage, however, created and revived
rivalry. On September 1, 1834, a great race for one thousand guineas
took place between 'Waterwitch,' brig, 331 tons, belonging to the Earl
of Belfast, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>(p. 325)</span> and 'Galatea,' schooner, 179 tons; in this race Mr.
Charles Ratsey sailed, and he is now hale and hearty in Cowes. The
course was from the Nab Lightship, round the Eddystone Lighthouse, and
back. The start took place at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, on the Monday morning, when the
weather was fine, wind tolerably fresh from south and west. The first
day, in the afternoon, the wind fell light, almost a calm at 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, the
yachts being then only off Dunnose, Isle of Wight. The schooner at this
time was two miles to windward. On Tuesday, at 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, the two yachts
were off Berry Head, Torbay, the schooner 'Galatea' still to windward.
About this time, as the breeze freshened, she had the misfortune to
carry away her jibboom, and got too close under Bolthead by the Start,
thereby losing her tide. They rounded the Eddystone nearly together;
from which point, both running large, the brig gradually drew away from
the schooner, and finally reached the Nab Lightship at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on
Wednesday, September 3, 'Galatea' coming in at 2.20 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The course was
about 130 miles, and the time occupied 52 hours. The race, in August
1842, also <span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>(p. 326)</span> round the Eddystone, in an easterly gale, between
'Corsair,' 80 tons, and 'Talisman,' 84 tons, is justly celebrated.
'Corsair' won by 1 min. 30 secs. Two pictures of this race were painted
by Condy, of Plymouth. Running down channel 'Corsair' is represented
with a mizzen, which Mr. Charles Ratsey informed the writer was stuck in
at the last minute and was carried away turning to windward; she is
therefore shown without one on her return.</p>

</div>

<p>There was talk of a race between the Marquis of Anglesey's 'Pearl' and
Mr. J. Weld's 'Alarm' for a thousand guineas, but it never came off; in
fact, the Marquis never raced her from the time 'Pearl' was built in
1821 to the year of his death, 1854. The 'Mosquito,' with Captain John
Nichols at the tiller, once came out on his weather, and the Marquis
very politely dipped his ensign to the yacht that weathered him for the
first time in all his years of cruising. The 'Arrow' and 'Mosquito' once
finished a fine race, which was a marvellously close thing between them,
'Arrow,' 6 hrs. 59 mins. 30 secs., 'Mosquito,' 6 hrs. 59 mins. 31

Thames. A cup had been subscribed for of the value of fifty guineas, and

</div>

<p>The race was from Greenwich to Gravesend and back, and it certainly was
not lacking in interest. The sport began early. 'Matchless' carried away
her boom, running into 'Lady Louisa's' quarter; 'Lady Louisa's' bowsprit
caught 'Rob Roy's' backstay, and she followed 'Matchless' ashore,
dragging 'Lady Louisa' after her. At this time 'Daisy' was leading. Soon
after 'Brilliant' became first and 'Ariel' second boat. In Erith Reach
on the return 'Venus' was waterlogged. 'Donna del Lago' carried away her
bowsprit; 'Vixen' carried away outhaul, and when she got into Erith
Roads 'Vixen's' mast <span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span> went by the board. Finally 'Brilliant'
won by 1 minute from 'Ariel,' who was second. They were both reefed down
to the balance-reef, as shown in the illustration taken from an old
print. Balance-reefs are seldom seen nowadays, although they are
occasionally carried by fishing craft.</p>

<p>There was one day's racing in 1892 which should be handed down as a
remarkable instance of what the new boats can do in a stress of weather.
It was Largs Regatta, July 12, when the Largs men witnessed and took
part in the kind of sport they so dearly love; they are severe critics,
but give honour where honour is due, especially to weatherly craft and
good seamanship. The wind was from the east, freshening up towards the
time for the start. Unfortunately 'Meteor' and 'Iverna' were not
competing, the former having damaged her gaff. The forties were there,
four in number&mdash;'Queen Mab,' 'Corsair,' 'Varuna,' and 'White Slave'&mdash;the
'Mohican' was flagship, in line with a flag on Largs Pier. It was a
truly wild morning, white squalls being frequent and severe. The Firth
was all spoondrift; 'Queen Mab' and 'Varuna' had housed topmasts, one
reef down, 'Corsair' topmast on end. Under Knockhill the squalls were
tremendously heavy, very patchy and local. Off Skelmorlie the racers got
the true east wind hard, and found the flagboat dragging her anchor.
They rounded, however: 'Queen Mab' was timed 11 hrs. 8 mins. 16 secs.,
'Varuna,' 11 hrs. 8 mins. 52 secs. Coming over towards Largs they got
into a lull, when 'Corsair' set her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>(p. 330)</span> gaff-topsail, 'Mab' and
'Varuna' getting topmasts on end; the latter set her topsail, the former
did not. Soon a mighty rush of wind burst down from between Tomont End
and Largs. At the 'Knock' again there was a kind of
vacuum-cum-Mäelström. Soon after, in a wilder phase of Clyde weather,
'Mab' and 'Varuna' were caught by a fierce squall and laid down to it.
'Corsair,' unfortunately, was the victim of a squall spout, which
carried away her mast close to the board&mdash;such was the strain that
something must have gone. The 'White Slave,' belonging to Mr. F. W. L.
Popham, was at this time off the Knock; she took in her topsail, and
nearing 'Corsair' further reduced her canvas, lowering her mainsail to
assist her. Ultimately 'Corsair' was towed by Duncan, of 'Madge' fame.
Skelmorlie mark was rounded at 12 hrs. 42 mins. 30 secs. by 'Queen Mab,'
at 12 hrs. 45 mins. 12 secs. by 'Varuna.'</p>

<p>After this all was flying spoondrift and canvas reduced to two
sails&mdash;the wind harder than ever. Smoking bows were the order of the
day, clouds of spray soaked the mainsails nearly to the peak, gaffs were
like rainbows in curve, all hands were warily standing by to lower
foresail or meet the next emergency. 'Queen Mab' finished in 1 hr. 43
mins. 35 secs., 'Varuna' 1 hr. 49 mins. 33 secs.</p>

<p>Parker sailed 'Queen Mab,' Gould 'Varuna,' Sycamore 'Corsair.' It was
indeed a hard blow, and a fine display of yacht handling and good
seamanship under most trying circumstances; the 'Yseult,' 10-tonner,
lost her bowsprit, and everybody lost something. All credit to the
skippers, who never lost their heads.</p>

EMPEROR OF GERMANY).</span><br>
<i>Dead heat in the Clyde, July 4, 1892.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The '6-rater' match seemed to be the joy of Largs, especially on this
occasion, when the weather enabled the crews to show what the Irish
boats could do. So much damage had been done that three only were left
to start: 'Red Lancer,' Col. Crawford, 'Savourna,' Mr. H. L. Mulholland,
and 'Windfall,' Mr. Gubbins. They seemed to revel in the storm; 'blow
high, blow low,' was all the same to them. More would have started had
they not been unhappily crippled in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>(p. 331)</span> one way or the other, but
those that did were nearly blown out of the water. The maxim of 'Batten
down' was in every case emphasised. After a tremendous experience of
what the Clyde can do to encourage real seamanship and fearless daring
'Savourna' came in at 2 hrs. 3 mins., and 'Red Lancer,' 2 hrs. 3 mins.
39 secs; 'Red Lancer' taking 1st prize, 'Savourna' 2nd prize. Largs
Regatta in 1892 will long be remembered; it was no flat racing, but real
steeplechasing in the Clyde.</p>

<p>1892 also leaves us a dead heat between the two champions of the season,
the 'Iverna' and the 'Meteor.' This occurred at the Royal Clyde Club,
July 4, 1892; wind W.N.W., a fine breeze, both carrying jibheaders at
the finish, as shown in the illustration. 'Iverna' led by 19 seconds&mdash;3
hrs. 25 mins. 28 secs., allowing 'Meteor' 19 seconds; 'Meteor' finished
at 3 hrs. 25 mins. 47 secs. Dead heat.</p>

<p>This was sailed off, July 8, in the Wemyss Bay programme, and resulted
in a very fine race, topmasts struck, first reef down in mainsail&mdash;real
going, both vessels made the most of and thoroughly well handled. Mr.
William Jameson and O'Neil were on 'Iverna,' and Gomes was at the tiller
of 'Meteor.' It was a grand exhibition of yacht-racing, and finished,
'Iverna,' 4 hrs. 18 mins. 26 secs., 'Meteor,' 4 hrs. 21 mins. 22 secs.</p>

<span class="smaller">RACING IN A 40-RATER IN 1892</span><br>
<span class="smcap">By R. T. Pritchett</span></h2>

<p>Most of the races described in these volumes are from the standpoint of
the looker-on ashore, or else on board some vessel which was not
competing; the present chapter describes a race from that point of
vantage, the deck of the winning yacht.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img164.jpg" width="150" height="265" alt="" title="">
<p>Going aloft.</p>
</div>

<p>Cowes in the early morn is not generally known to visitors. The 'wood
and brass work'&mdash;a term better known on board than on shore&mdash;is now in
full swing, for this admirable function must be completed by eight
bells. If cleanliness be next to godliness, surely yachts have very much
to commend them, with their spotless decks, bleached runners, and
immaculate canvas. In leaving the pontoon for the offing, the various
craft increase in size as the water deepens. First the small raters are
passed, &frac12;-, 1-, 2&frac12;-raters, 'Wee Winn,' 'Polynia,' 'Hoopoo,' and
'Kitten'&mdash;described by 'Thalassa' in his Solent chapter. Passing the
tens and twenties the French yachts are reached, for of late years the
burgee of the French club is often seen at Cowes, and the American flag
is more frequent than of yore. The Guard-ship now looms. The Royal
yacht, 'Victoria and Albert,' is at her buoy, the Royal Yacht Squadron
nobly represented. Eight bells now strike. Immediately the morning
flutter of bunting flies to the mastheads, where all the burgees should
arrive simultaneously, taking the time from the flagship&mdash;but they do
not, unfortunately. (N.B.&mdash;Racing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>(p. 333)</span> flags can be lashed before
eight bells, as they have no halliards.) By this time we see the 40 just
astern of a yawl and ahead of a Frenchman. 'Queen Mab' is basking and
glistening in the bright morning sunshine, in perfect repose, yet rather
fretting to be off, for with her colour she knows what is coming. Having
come alongside very carefully, without touching the varnish, we are soon
on board, and find all in motion. The business of the day has begun, the
preliminary functions are completed, such as sending the gig away with
the superfluous gear of squeegees, mops, oars. The 12-ft. dinghy is
already lashed over the skylight, with the stem wedged up to the coaming
abaft of the companion. The tyers are off the mainsail, and it is soon
on the hoist. The crew are going aloft, to string down on the throat
halliards; gradually the peak rises, well up, about 45°, and with the
modern lacing down to the boom the sail soon becomes fairly set. Next,
the gaff topsail. In America, in the 'Puritan' and other racers,
photography shows that they start with two, jibheader and jackyarder or
club foresail, so called from the club or yard at the foot. In the
'Vigilant,' the jackyarder was set most cleverly over the jibheaded
topsail when running back in the final race. In joining a racer there is
nothing so comfortable for host and guest too as being on board in good
time. With a flying start it is very important to be under way to the
minute, especially in light <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> winds and with a tide running, such
as the swill in Cowes Roads generally is, whether spring or otherwise.
It is no joke for a boatman to catch a racer once under way, even
without her head sails, in the offing, to say nothing of the anathemas
of the owner, and the skipper's suppressed comments.</p>

<p>Soon comes the welcome of the owner of 'Queen Mab,' Col. T. B. C. West,
well known in the yachting world in connection with that grand yawl
'Wendur,' 143 tons, T.M., built in 1883, his famous 10-rater 'Queen Mab'
in the Clyde, and now the 'Queen Mab' of 1892. The forties are a very
prominent class and justly so; they emphasise the sport of class racing
over handicaps.</p>

<p>About this time the racing flags of other craft are a subject of intense
interest, and the crew are immensely keen. Should an old adversary not
be getting under way, the why and wherefore will be at once discussed;
this generally brings out prominently any hand of the 'sea lawyer'
class, if the owner has unfortunately shipped one. The head sails have
now been set, and we are curvetting and pirouetting about waiting for
preparatory gun. There is no doubt that wonderful skill is shown in the
handling of the various craft. A dexterity and firmness are apparent
which could never be secured with the American system of adjusted time:
thus if 'Vigilant' were four minutes late at the start, that time would
be deducted from the winner at the finish. Now comes the full excitement
of the start. 'First gun, sir; fifteen minutes to go!' is the word, and
for the next eighteen minutes all is extra wariness, sometimes fourteen
yachts under way, man&oelig;uvring, and keenly watching each other. 'Blue
Peter, sir, five minutes!' is next heard. The owner, watch in hand, by
the skipper, records the fleeting moments as they pass, calling out the
minutes: at length it comes to 1 min., 50 secs., 40 secs., 30 secs., 20
secs. 'How much, sir?' 'Ten seconds'; then 'Let her go!' and she
goes&mdash;with her cranse iron over the line directly after the gun.
Everyone now turns attention to the recall numbers. Are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>(p. 335)</span> there
any? There has been such a thing as three over the line out of four
starters, so great is the eagerness for a lead.</p>

<p>Among the larger classes everyone looks out for Mr. Jameson being first
over line, with O'Neil at the tiller, famed for his special gift for
quick starting and weather berths. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span> A good start is a grand
beginning. So long as one is leading no explanation is required why the
good ship is not showing her best form, or how it is that she is not in
her right trim. By this time the fleet is getting sorted; with a good
sailing breeze the large craft draw out ahead in many cases, and it is
well to do <span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span> so; the large cutters are started, say, a quarter of
an hour ahead, and the forties together. In 1892 the forties were very
strongly represented, 'Thalia,' 'Reverie,' 'Queen Mab,' 'Corsair,'
'Creole,' 'Varuna,' 'White Slave.' This gave most interesting sport, far
preferable to handicapping, which is only adopted to bring vessels of
different tonnage together. A curious instance of this occurred at
Cowes, when 'Irex,' 'Genesta,' and 'Lorna' all came in together within
five minutes, and having brought up, stowed canvas and dined, it was
discovered that 'Sleuthhound' was coming in, almost saving her time
allowance of about 53 min. It is certainly most uninteresting to the
spectators on shore to see the first fine craft come in close together,
and returning from afternoon tea to perhaps discover that the real
winner is just sailing in round the flagboat and getting the gun.</p>

<p>'Irex,' midship section.</p>
</div>

<p>By this time the 'sun is over the foreyard' and all are settling down
for a fine race. Sailing in a race affords excellent opportunity for
noticing the other competing craft and admiring the goodly company
assembled around. The big cutters are leading, and some of the forties
astern. That 'Queen Mab' will hold her own with the best is a point upon
which we feel happily confident, her racing flags being proof of her
capacity&mdash;thirty-six is the number she showed at the end of the season.
This yacht, as mentioned elsewhere, was built with a centreboard, but
instead of a huge partition in the centre of the saloon, the board came
under the main companion, and was quite unnoticeable. As with Mr.
Jameson's 'Irex,' 'Mab's' centreboard was discarded, and each became the
crack of her respective season. 'Varuna,' also a new boat this year,
designed by Mr. G. L. Watson with a Watson bow, as in 'Mab,' was a
beautiful craft, really perhaps the designer's favourite. These bows,
with those in 'Corsair' and others, elicited sighs and groans from the
old school of yachting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span> men; for what with the schooner bow, the
Viking bow, the inverted Roman nose bow, the bottle-nose bow, the Fife
bow, and the canoe bow, one's idea of what a bow should be became
somewhat confused. However, overhang forward carries the day up to 200
tons. 'Corsair,' 40-rater, designed by Mr. Arthur Payne of Southampton,
was a grand boat, with less beam than 'Mab,' beautiful counter, long
boom, very workmanlike all round. She was built for that enthusiastic
yachtsman, Admiral the Hon. Victor Montagu, a dear lover of all good
English sports. 'Thalia' was a fine craft, by Fife of Fairlie,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>(p. 340)</span> a splendid sea boat. Many is the good race Mr. Inglis has
sailed in her, with Carter, who sailed 'Britannia,' 1893, at the tiller.</p>

<p>We live in an age of rather rapid development; 1892 becomes ancient
history in 1893, still it seems sad that when one has a good vessel like
'Thalia,' she should so soon be outclassed. Fashion always runs to
extremes; now that fashion has attacked yachting, the belle of one
season is extinguished in the next. 'Sic tempora et naves mutantur.' In
old days enthusiastic yacht-owners lengthened their pets, almost rebuilt
them sometimes, as in the cases of 'Alarm' and 'Arrow'; the associations
were retained and duly cherished.</p>

<p>We have started, it should have been said, for the Australian Cup, value
50<i>l.</i>, presented by Mr. Gibson Miller for yachts exceeding 20 tons and
not exceeding 40 tons. The second prize, 30<i>l.</i>, is given by the Royal
Squadron. The westerly wind turned out very light, and without a good
sailing breeze racing becomes peaceful repose. Much interest, however,
is felt in the performance of 'Irene,' 40-rater, designed by Mr. G. L.
Watson for Prince Henry of Prussia, who was at the tiller all day, heart
and soul in it, longing for a breeze, and probably keeping up the old
superstition by giving an unintentional whistle for one; but still it
would not come. At 4 hrs. 0 min. 35 secs. 'Queen Mab' came in the
winner, 'Thalia' taking second prize.</p>

<p>For real racing a true wind, such as we had in the race for prizes given
by the Royal Southampton Yacht Club, August 6, is indispensable. This
was a small but sporting muster. 'Iverna' and 'Meteor' were sent away at
10.45 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, 'Iverna' crossing the line to a second. The forties,
'Corsair,' 'Queen Mab,' and 'Thalia,' were despatched half an hour later
at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, to a perfect start and a whole-sail westerly breeze, 'Mab'
crossing two seconds after the Blue Peter was hauled down. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>(p. 341)</span>
gun missed fire. We hailed the Committee Boat, 'Are we all right?' when
the pleasant echo returned, 'All right, go on,' and away we went.</p>

<p>It was a fine reach down Southampton Water, the three close together in
single file. Passing Calshot Lightship we hauled our wind and stood over
for Cowes, feeling the westerly breeze which came sweeping up from the
Needles; below Egypt we went about and took our jumps merrily&mdash;a nasty
sea, if the sea can be nasty; our working topsail relieved her
somewhat&mdash;for 'Corsair' and 'Thalia' were carrying jackyarders. It was a
grand beat down to Lymington; the rain was heavy, but after a few hard
squalls the sun came out and the Lymington mark-boat was rounded, 'Queen
Mab' 12 hrs. 45 mins. 10 secs., 'Corsair' 12 hrs. 46 mins. 20 secs.,
'Thalia' 12 hrs. 47 mins. 35 secs. As the mark-boat was neared all were
astir. 'Get your gear on your spinnaker boom, my lads, and top him as
soon as you can. Will you take the time, sir, of "Meteor" and "Iverna"
rounding?' Before this our masthead man George had gone aloft by an
acrobatic performance which is always interesting to the beholder: on
the port tack with the port foot on a hoop, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>(p. 342)</span> the starboard
foot on the sail, as indicated in the illustration. George was a good
compact cheery hand, and must have been born for this particular
function. By this time we are round.</p>

<p>'Down spinnaker boom,' and now every thread draws and the whole sail is
pulling hard. 'All aft, my sonnies!' and the skipper Parker seems to
smile upon his pet. At this time bread and cheese and beer are served
out, and form a very pleasant pendant to 'all aft' except the look-out,
who took his mid-day in solitude by the unfilled foresail. A splendid
dead run from the Lymington mark back to Cowes now takes place. See!
'Corsair's' spinnaker is here suddenly taken in, Sycamore, her skipper,
having discovered that her mast was sprung, and he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>(p. 343)</span> therefore
went into Cowes. This was a great disappointment to us, and must have
been to Admiral Victor Montagu, who so dearly loves racing, especially
in a true wind. We were now cracking on for the Warner, our enjoyment
only once disturbed by a hail from the look-out, 'Boat right under bow,
sir,' and in the same breath, 'Only a photogger, sir,' and on we sped.
Rounding the Warner 'Thalia' carried away her throat halliards, but soon
continued the race. Rounding mark-boats and lightships is thrilling
work, and beautifully it is done on 'Queen Mab.' It is delightful to see
the judgment and decision, and how cheerily the hands haul on to the
mainsheet; truly this is sport and excitement not easily beaten. 'Queen
Mab' bends gracefully to it, and well it suits her; we are hissing
through it. It is generally supposed that racing yachts are regularly
gralloched and cleared out below; it is so in America and was done to
'Navahoe' in her races; but it is not so here. Everything is in its
place, and when the head of the steward appears at the companion with
the welcome words, 'Lunch, sir!' we find that all is well&mdash;but look out
for the swinging table: touch that and there <span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span> will be a ghastly
crash. The 40-rater has the owner's cabin and the lady's cabin, with a
very comfortable one for a guest, to say nothing of accommodation for
sea bachelors who do not require shore luxury. The ladies' conning tower
is generally the top step of the companion, but in the 'Seabelle' Mrs.
Taylor had an armchair swung like a gimbal compass, in which she knitted
comfortably at whatever angle the yacht might be in a seaway. After
lunch we are close-hauled lying for Calshot Castle, hissing through it
with a pleasant swish of spray, ever and anon making some of the hands
duck their heads as they lie up to windward. Many is the dry remark and
cheery yarn that one hears under these circumstances; not many words but
much to the purpose, old recollections are revived, and there is always
something to be learnt.</p>

<p>Real business.</p>
</div>

<p>Each hand is on the look-out in calm weather, scouring the horizon for a
wandering catspaw, or in bad weather, watching the other craft to see
how they take it. To note the skipper's face is a study; his eye on
every leach and every sheet, keen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span> and ready for any emergency,
entirely absorbed in 'her' and how she is going and how he can best
cosset her. Such was the impression left of Ben Parker at the tiller of
'Queen Mab.' He had done good work in Mr. Hill's 'Dragons' of the 20's.
His first command was the 'Ulidia,' Fife's 10-tonner, after having
sailed for some years under Tom Diaper and O'Neil, and his Channel race
from Dover in 1892 will never be forgotten. It was a merry close haul
back from the Warner to Southampton Water. As the wind was drawing down
the river we had a beat up to the Committee-boat, which was reached,
'Queen Mab' 4 hrs. 9 mins. 57 secs., winner, 40<i>l.</i> and silver medal;
'Thalia,' 4 hrs. 58 mins., second prize 10<i>l.</i> 'Thalia,' built by Fife
of Fairlie, had a rare good crew, and Mr. I. A. Inglis has sailed many a
famous race in her with his skipper, Carter, whose season of 1893 in
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales's 'Britannia' speaks for itself. We get the
'gun,' that great joy at the end of a good race. 'Down foresail,' and
round she comes. The cheering is over, so now to clear up. Unlash the
dinghy, get back the cutter and gear, and fill in the Declaration, which
has to be sent in by every owner or his representative immediately after
a race is won. It runs thus:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="center"><i>Y.R.A. Declaration that Rules have been observed</i></p>

<p>I hereby declare that <span class="add5em">yacht</span> whilst sailing in the
  <span class="add3em">Race</span> this day has strictly observed the sailing Rules and
  Regulations.</p>

<p>Date <span class="add2em">.</span>          <span class="add5em">Signed</span></p>
</div>

<p>The gig is by this time alongside, and it must have been delightful to
the owner as he stepped into her and left the side of the victorious
'Queen Mab,' to look up and see five winning flags flying, representing
five first prizes in five starts in one week.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this chapter to record all 'Queen Mab's'
victories, but it may be noted that she won the 40<i>l.</i> prize given by
the Royal Dorset Yacht Club in August of this year&mdash;1892. The club was
founded in 1875, and holds <span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>(p. 346)</span> forth many inducements to
yacht-owners to visit Weymouth. For small raters it is admirably
adapted, as the Esplanade is of immense length, and the short courses
can be seen from one end to the other.</p>

<p>At Dartmouth also 'Queen Mab' had two fine races, in a hard wind round
the Skerries. The first, August 26, was very good, but the second,
August 27, was better, though only one round, at the end of which we
found the flagboat bottom up. 'Queen Mab' won first prize on both days.
At Plymouth, in the following week, continuing the 'Westward Ho'
procession, 'Mab' sailed over, with double-reef mainsail No. 3 and jib,
no foresail, 'Thalia' and 'Corsair' not caring to start. Outside the
Breakwater it was very grand, and outside Rame Head grander still, as
the rollers came in after a 48 hours' gale. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>(p. 348)</span> pilot
admired 'Mab' immensely, she made such good weather of it. The gale was
great sport for us, and it was surprising to see how the small boats
thrashed through it. 'Dis' carried away her bowsprit, and there was much
harmless wreckage of gear. One lesson might be learnt, that with the
short bowsprit produced by the overhang forward there is much strain
taken off that very important spar. Plymouth often gets a hard blow
about this time, which is the more to be regretted from the
extraordinary variety of boats and classes, from the 'Britannia' class
down to the rowing matches of the bum-boat women. Devonport and the Navy
training brigs and colleges all join the water frolic, and great is the
disappointment when the weather is unfavourable.</p>

<span class="smaller">YACHT RACING IN 1893</span><br>
<span class="smcap">By H. Horn</span></h2>

<p>An exceptional year, alike in regard to weather and sport, for not
within living memory has there been so fine a spring, summer and autumn,
and there is no previous record of such a sequence of eventful and
stirring racing. It is highly gratifying that sport so truly national in
character as yacht racing enlisted more general interest during the past
season than has ever previously been the case; in fact, it can further
be said that the doings of the 'Britannia,' 'Valkyrie,' 'Satanita,'
'Calluna,' 'Navahoe,' and 'Iverna' arrested world-wide attention.</p>

<p>Lord Dunraven's commission, given in the fall of 1892, for a new
'Valkyrie' of about double the rating of his first cutter of that name,
heralded a revival of big-cutter racing, and later on yachting
enthusiasts were almost delirious with joy when authentic announcements
were made that the Prince of Wales had given orders for a sister ship to
the 'Valkyrie,' and that a big cutter was to be built at Southampton for
Mr. A. D. Clarke, and one on the Clyde for a syndicate of Scotch
yachtsmen.</p>

<p>Mr. G. L. Watson had a free hand in designing the 'Valkyrie' and
'Britannia,' which were built side by side at Partick by Messrs.
Henderson, and parenthetically it may be said they fitted out, moored
together, and kept singularly close company in all their matches. The
'Satanita,' which was designed by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>(p. 350)</span> Mr. J. Soper to sail on a
94-feet water-line, was built by Fay &amp; Co., while Mr. W. Fife, junr. was
responsible for the 'Calluna's' model, and the vessel was built by
Messrs. J. &amp; A. Inglis of Pointhouse, Glasgow, in an incredibly short
space of time. Although very certain that the 'Iverna' would be quite
outbuilt by the new ships, Mr. John Jameson determined to bring her out,
and 'Iverna's' well-tried antagonist, the 'Meteor,' was under orders to
join the fleet later on.</p>

<p>Just before the advent of the new year, Lord Dunraven's challenge for
the new 'Valkyrie' to sail a series of races for the America Cup was
accepted by the New York Yacht Club, and about the same time came a
notification from Mr. Carroll, a prominent American yachtsman, that he
was having a sloop (the 'Navahoe') built by Messrs. Herreshoff, with
which he intended to challenge for the Royal Victoria Gold Cup, and also
make an attempt to win back the Cape May and Brenton Reef Cups.</p>

<p>The year was thus launched auspiciously enough in respect to big ship
racing, and prospects were reassuring in regard to sport in all the
other classes except the tens. There was a fining down however in number
of the 40-rating division compared to 1892, and regrets were general
that the sale of the 'Queen Mab' had led to her expatriation. But
Admiral Montagu was replacing the absentee 'Corsair' with the
'Vendetta,' a fin-bulb and balance-rudder craft, with a beam of about 17
feet, and Mr. John Gretton, jun., who did not get much fun out of the
10-rater 'Doreen,' had determined on having a 40 from a Fife design, the
outcome being the 'Lais.' 'Varuna' was being fitted out again by Capt.
Towers-Clark, and the 'Thalia,' which had passed into the possession of
Judge Boyd, was to be raced, but not to go all round the coast. The
second class was thus virtually made up of 'Vendetta,' 'Varuna,' and
'Lais,' which verily proved a militant trio, and their owners had plenty
of racing, and no end of exciting and eventful sport. With the new
'Dragon'&mdash;the third of that name Fife's had built for Mr. F. C.
Hill&mdash;Lord <span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>(p. 351)</span> Dunraven's 'Deirdré,' by 'Valkyrie's' designer, and
the 'Vigorna,' by Nicholson&mdash;which Lord Dudley intended to take the
place of the 5-rater 'Dacia'&mdash;there was promise of keen competition for
the 20-rating prizes; but it was not in the best interests of sport that
a joint arrangement was made that this class would not be raced outside
the Isle of Wight&mdash;at least from the beginning of the season, until the
Western meetings came on in the fall. The 'Zinita,' a new 20 by Fife,
had things pretty much her own way on the Clyde, and it was a pity that
she did not meet the new boats which starred in Southern waters.
'Idalia'&mdash;the first 'Dragon'&mdash;was the 'Zinita's' most formidable
opponent on the Clyde, and the 'Molly'&mdash;'Dragon' the second&mdash;after a
good spell of Solent racing, went North, but found the 'Zinita' as bad
to beat as she did the 'Dragon' and the 'Deirdré.' There were no new
boats in the 10-rating class, and racing in this division was confined
to the Clyde, where the 'Dora,' 'Ptarmigan,' 'Maida,' 'Phantom' and
'Woodcock' had some good sport. The 6-raters, which were a feature in
the Clyde and Irish regatta programmes in 1892, had gone out of fashion,
and 23-feet 'lengthers' were the reigning favourites with small shipmen
on the Clyde, Mr. Robt. Wylie's 'Vida,' a Watson design, being the crack
in a fleet of eight. The Solent 5-rating class could not boast of a new
boat, and the 'Dacia,' although she headed the list of prize-winners in
the South, did not sail up to her 1892 form. The 'Red Lancer,' which
went all round the coast, was the pride of the season of the fives, and
she was equal to taking down 'Dacia' pretty easily. The 'Fleur-de-Lis'
and 'Quinque' also frequently lowered 'Dacia's' colours, and honours
were about easy with the trio at the end of the season. In the
2&frac12;-rating class the 'Meneen,' a Herreshoff boat, had a better average
than the over-year Nicholson boat, 'Gareth,' and in the 1-rating class
the 'Morwena'&mdash;another Herreshoff&mdash;was the principal winner. It cannot
be said that the branch of the sport known as handicap sailing
flourished during the season, though there were some keen and
interesting battles with the ex-racers. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>(p. 352)</span> most successful
vessels in this division were the 'Creole,' 'Castanet,' 'Columbine,'
'Mabel' and 'Sam&oelig;na.'</p>

<p>The big-cutter contests were of such exceptional interest that a review
of the season would not be complete without a history of all the races
sailed, and the opportunity is embraced of embodying many unreported
incidents in the subjoined <i lang="fr">résumé</i> of the first-class racing.</p>

</div>

<p>There was a thoroughly representative assemblage of yachtsmen afloat the
first day the big cutters had racing flags lashed up, and it may be said
that never during the half-century the Royal Thames has been an
institution has a more critical company, collectively, been present at a
river match of the premier metropolitan club. A white haze was hanging
about the lower Thames on the morning of Thursday, May 25, and when the
'Valkyrie,' 'Britannia,' 'Calluna' and 'Iverna' were ready to answer the
starting gun, a breeze from the west-north-west of balloon topsail
strength was blowing. The quartet began the race at 12.5, and went
reaching down the Lower Hope, with flowing sheets and carrying a swirl
of ebb-tide with them. 'Valkyrie' had made a clever start, and keeping
to the Essex side was first to square away in Sea Reach, and get
spinnaker set to port. 'Britannia' had been edged off to the heart of
the fairway, but about Thames Haven she was drawn in across 'Valkyrie's'
wake, and straightened on a down-river course directly she had angled
the latter's wind. 'Valkyrie's' first racing burst was satisfactory,
inasmuch as she kept pride of place for about 14 miles, albeit she never
held more than a clear length's lead of 'Britannia.' About a couple of
miles below Southend the wind had a hank off the sands, and, with square
canvas gathered and sheets trimmed in a little, 'Britannia' raced up
broad on the weather beam of 'Valkyrie,' while wide away 'Calluna' was
booming along with a rally of wind aft, and for a few minutes certainly
led the fleet. On an easy reach 'Britannia' gave evidence that she had
the foot of the sister ship, yet it was a marvellously close race, the
Prince of Wales's cutter drawing by the wind round <span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>(p. 353)</span> the Mouse
at 2.10 with about three lengths lead of 'Valkyrie,' while the 'Calluna'
was only 1 min. 11 secs. and 'Iverna' 2 mins. 5 secs. astern of the
leader. With a beat back over a lee tide in perspective the lead round
the lightship was an immense advantage, and, in order to keep weather
gauge, 'Britannia' was kept shooting so long that 'Valkyrie' had no
chance of a successful hug, and it would have been suicidal for her to
have turned about in the body of the tide. The alternative was sailing
hard to get the wind clear to leeward; but when 'Valkyrie' came round
outside the edge of the tide rift, 'Britannia,' drawing a foot less
water, was able to cast about dead in the wind's eye of her rival. A
grand breeze squeezing trial went on right up Sea Reach, 'Valkyrie,'
although the quicker of the pair in stays, getting now and again a
staggering weather bower. It was a racing treat, however, and, despite
the duel, the 'Calluna' and 'Iverna' were getting a hollow beating. The
breeze freshened with the flood, and from off Shellhaven 'Britannia,'
which was a bare hundred yards to windward of 'Valkyrie,' was, on
starboard, pointing clear of the Blyth, and did not therefore follow her
rival on an inshore cast. After passing the Lower Hope point, sheets
were checked, jib topsails and balloon staysails were set, and, with a
puffy breeze broad off the Essex side, they went straight up the fairway
pushing on a big bow wave. 'Britannia' going thus free was dropping
'Valkyrie' a trifle, yet the race looked open until 'Valkyrie's'
bowsprit snapped short off close to the stem head. She was eased in to
the weather shore, and her topmast saved in a wonderful way, and
eventually she followed 'Britannia' home. 'Calluna' had split her big
jib across the diagonal seam in Sea Reach, but got another set, and
looked likely&mdash;consequent on 'Valkyrie's' mishap&mdash;to gain second
honours. An attempt, however, to pass inside the Ovens ended by
'Calluna' sticking deep in the mud, and 'Iverna' got home soon enough to
save her time on 'Valkyrie.' This, the first race, was a fair trial to
leeward and to windward, and it showed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>(p. 354)</span> 'Britannia' and
'Valkyrie' to be wonderfully evenly matched, while 'Calluna's' <i lang="fr">début</i>
was disappointing.</p>

<p>The valedictory match on the river on May 27 proved the best racing
test, and furnished the most stirring sport of the trio. 'Valkyrie' was
ready to join in, and the fleet was similarly constituted to the opening
day. The race was under the Royal London burgee, and was sailed in
gloomy weather and a smart <span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>(p. 355)</span> north-east breeze. A sensation was
served up before the contest proper had been started, and directly after
the heavily freighted official steamer had got down to the Lower Hope,
through 'Calluna's' mast breaking off short as a Jersey cabbage-stalk.
With her whole canvas pile carrying away over the side it was feared
some of the crew might be entangled; but luckily everything went clear
and no one was hurt. It was 12.45 before the Commodore started the race,
and at the time the Hope was full of trading craft. A bulky hopper
barred 'Britannia's' way, and both 'Valkyrie' and 'Iverna' had to be
shoved up in the wind; and while the two last named were hovering,
'Britannia' stood away for the Kent side into the full scour of the ebb,
and came off on the starboard tack in weather berth. 'Valkyrie' had to
short tack at the top of Sea Reach to clear her wind, and as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356"></a>(p. 356)</span> a
long leg could be made, 'Britannia' reached away with the lead,
'Valkyrie,' half a dozen lengths astern, pointing high for her weather
quarter. The wind was puffy and both dropped 'Iverna,' but the two
leaders were sailing a grand race, and made a long stretch as far as the
East River Middle without breaking port tack. Hereabout, however, the
wind suddenly shortened on them from the eastward, and the 'Valkyrie'
most unluckily was thrown dead under the lee of 'Britannia.' With the
tide soaking them bodily to windward, they both fetched under the Nore
Sand, which had to be stood from for water, and by short turnings they
then made a fine race to the Nore Lightship. Here they got in deep
water, and after a short hitch and a rap-full stretch to clear had
failed, 'Valkyrie' went in for short boards of about twenty seconds, and
ended by being given lee helm directly she was full. This meant that
'Britannia,' being slower in stays, had not got sheets in before she
wanted to go about again, and she would to a certainty have been
weathered by 'Valkyrie,' before getting as far on as the West Oaze, had
not the Prince of Wales's cutter been treated to longer boards.
'Britannia' then got away and weathered the Mouse, after as fine a
display of short tacking as has ever been seen on the river, with a lead
of 39 seconds, and the duel had let 'Iverna' get within 10 minutes of
the leader. They ran back against the tide with spinnakers to port; but
it was dead running, and 'Valkyrie,' edging in to the Maplins, got
through into first place above the Admiralty mile. The wind then came
off shore, and 'Britannia' at once began to luff in. 'Valkyrie' was
determined to keep her weather wind clear, the pair had a match up to
Southend, and on keeping away both touched the ground, the 'Britannia'
bumping three times hard on the north head of Leigh Sand. The Prince of
Wales's cutter, however, keeping wide, slipped past 'Valkyrie' about the
Chapman, drew to, and came fair ahead. The pair kept up a grand race on
the Essex side of the river, but 'Iverna,' greatly favoured by the wind
and her opponents' jockeying, had got within a couple of minutes of the
leaders when off <span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>(p. 358)</span> Holehaven. Spinnakers were carried through
the Hope, and a grand race finished with a free reach from Coalhouse
Point home, 'Britannia' beating 'Valkyrie' by 73 seconds; but 'Iverna'
won the prize by time.</p>

</div>

<p>A very fine open-water match was that of the Royal Thames Club on June
10 from the Nore round the back of the Goodwins to Dover. The usual tale
of five of the national rig and the schooner 'Amphitrite' made up the
entry, and all mustered at the rendezvous. It was a cheerless morning,
the sky being heavy and of slaty hue, whilst a brisk north-easter blew
cold off the water. The schooner had a yard-topsail set, 'Calluna' her
No. 2 jackyarder, and the 'Britannia,' 'Valkyrie,' 'Satanita,' and
'Iverna' their jibheaders. Reef-tackles were ready to pull earings down,
but the breeze veered to the east north-east and did not harden. They
had a beat to the Tongue with a swinging weather tide, 'Britannia' made
a capital start, and twice crossed ahead of 'Valkyrie'; but exactly half
an hour after the start, off the 'West Oaze,' 'Britannia' found her
sister marching clear ahead. 'Calluna' had been in Tilbury Dock since
her inglorious performance at Harwich; she was there lightened of tons
of dead weight, and the syndicate ship was very much livelier, and
infinitely more able at breeze squeezing; while the turnings were too
short for 'Satanita' to be cutting a dash. 'Britannia' jumped up on
'Valkyrie' every time the long leg on port came, and at the entrance of
the Alexandra Channel 'Valkyrie,' on the bearing tack, had to come about
under the lee bow, the Prince of Wales's cutter thus becoming 'bell
wether.' 'Valkyrie' stayed for 'Britannia,' which was however on port,
but the former was clear enough ahead before getting abreast of the
beacons on the Girdler. The two leading boats worked shorter tacks than
the rest down the Alexandra to the southern pitch of the Shingles, and
they were consequently getting picked up a little by 'Calluna' and
'Satanita.' After a long leg on port, the last tack was made for
weathering distance of the Tongue Lightship, and on passing this mark
after a beat of 19 miles with a weather tide, the 'Valkyrie' led
'Britannia' 2 mins., 'Calluna' <span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>(p. 359)</span> 7 mins. 30 secs., 'Satanita' 9
mins. 30 secs., and 'Iverna' 15 mins. 30 secs. It may be said that the
distance was covered by the leader in 2 hrs. 18 mins. After allowing for
a sweep of fair tide they had a broad reach off to the North Sandhead,
and although 'Britannia' raced up on 'Valkyrie,' she stopped directly
she began to yaw about on the leader's quarter sea, and was half a
minute astern at the North Goodwin Lightship. 'Satanita's' was a
remarkable piece of sailing, as according to the 'distance table' it is
14&frac34; miles from the Tongue Lightship to the North Sandhead, and she
was timed officially as taking just over one hour to do the distance; it
should be added that the tide was running about two knots, and setting
under the weather quarter, whilst it is worthy of note that between the
marks 'Satanita' had two luffs with 'Calluna' and shifted her jibheaded
topsail for a jackyarder. In a run to the East Goodwin main booms were
carried to starboard, and 'Britannia,' running the nearer to the sands,
was placed to cover 'Valkyrie,' when an inevitable gybe came off at the
East Goodwin. 'Valkyrie' came over all standing just after passing the
lightship, and unluckily for her the parts of the mainsheet got under
the counter. 'Britannia' was also gybed in a hurry, and, covering her
opponent, she slipped past into pride of place, while 'Valkyrie' was
unable to pull her boom in and luff; oddly enough, however, 'Britannia'
was in the same mess as her sister, and it was some time ere both had
mainsheets running free through the blocks. With the North Sea tide
swinging along hot, a fine head of speed was kept up, and about the
Calliper head-sails were taking well and spinnakers were got in.
Although the wind was quarterly from the Southsand Lightship home,
'Britannia' made but a very trifling gain on 'Valkyrie,' and, according
to official clocking, crossed the line with a lead of 17 secs., and,
having 13 secs. to allow, thus won with 3 secs. to spare&mdash;a remarkable
finish of a grand race. 'Satanita' was 5 mins. 52 secs. astern of the
leader, 'Calluna' 7 mins. 26 secs., and 'Iverna' 18 mins. 32 secs.</p>

<p>A smart easterly wind on the morning of the cross Channel <span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360"></a>(p. 360)</span>
match from Dover to Boulogne very naturally gave rise to anticipations
that the time record for the course would be broken. The breeze came
unsteady, however, and put a veto on the accomplishment of a fast
journey either way, whilst a serious collision at the start, in which
the 'Valkyrie,' 'Britannia,' and 'Vendetta' were involved, had the
effect of utterly spoiling the race. A fleet of eight responded to the
starting gun&mdash;namely, 'Britannia,' 'Valkyrie,' 'Calluna,' 'Iverna,'
'Mabel,' 'Lais,' 'Vendetta,' and 'Varuna'&mdash;and they ran in close flight
for the line before a north-east wind, with booms to starboard and
having a gybe to make immediately after crossing. 'Vendetta' got away
first and was reaching off on her course when 'Valkyrie's' bowsprit end
took the 40 on the port quarter and forced her round until she filled on
the starboard tack, her topmast being carried away as she was slewing.
There was not much room between the outer flagboat and the port side of
'Valkyrie,' but 'Britannia's' helm was drawn down&mdash;after gybing&mdash;to give
her a chance of finding a passage. She fouled the mark, however, and
through 'Valkyrie's' way being deadened when she fouled 'Vendetta,'
'Britannia' had the alternative of steadying her helm and giving
'Valkyrie' a sliding blow, or of keeping it a little a-lee and crashing
right through the 40. The 'Britannia's' helm was eased, and she put her
bowsprit inside 'Valkyrie's' rigging, while 'Vendetta,' after getting
her bowsprit broken off by 'Britannia,' got some of the gear foul and
dropped alongside the Prince of Wales's vessel, with her counter up
about level with the big cutter's main rigging, and the stem even with
the taffrail. The three vessels, locked together, sidled away towards
shore, 'Britannia,' listing to the wind, pressed her mainsail on to
'Vendetta's' port crosstree, and the sail split up from boom to gaff.
The trio laid thus entangled for ten minutes, but meantime 'Valkyrie's'
crew had chopped away at 'Britannia's' bowsprit and headgear; eventually
the spar broke, and then the three vessels at once got clear. Meanwhile
'Calluna' and 'Iverna' had been racing away for the French coast with a
fine leading wind, and twelve minutes after <span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361"></a>(p. 361)</span> they had crossed
the line 'Valkyrie' started in pursuit. The wind was shy and very puffy
after getting inside Grisnez, and 'Valkyrie' picked up six minutes on
'Calluna,' which had beaten 'Iverna' only 3 mins. 45 secs. in going
across, and 'Varuna,' the leading 40, by 24 mins. 'Calluna' hung on to
her jackyard topsail in a wonderful way, as some of the puffs laid her
over until the lee decks were full. 'Valkyrie' passed 'Iverna,' but
'Calluna' well kept her lead, the wind easting enough for all to fetch
clean full home. 'Calluna' beat 'Valkyrie' by 5 mins. 27 secs., 'Iverna'
by 8 mins. 52 secs., and 'Lais,' the first of the 40's, by 46 mins. 6
secs.</p>

<p>'Calluna,' 141-rater (Peter Donaldson, Esq.)</p>
</div>

<p>There was a full muster of the heavy-weight cutters at the Royal
Southern rendezvous, the club having a first-class match on June 17, the
second day of its 'Jubilee' Regatta. 'Satanita's' light blue banner was
carried nearer the water-level than in her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page362" name="page362"></a>(p. 362)</span> previous racing
essays, owing to the lower mast having been clipped 3 feet, and
additional lead had been put on her keel. 'Britannia' had made good the
damage sustained at Dover, and with 'Valkyrie,' 'Calluna,' and 'Iverna'
the fleet was brought up to normal strength. It was a lovely morning,
glorified by fervent sunshine, and softened by a gauzy haze, but a
southerly chill was not strong enough to 'carry' the smoke of the
starting gun, and the surface of the Solent looked smooth as burnished
steel. With flying airs filling jackyard topsails, they started the
race, and ere going half a mile 'Calluna' got aground on the Calshot
Spit. 'Valkyrie' was lucky to strike the first of a gathering breeze,
and went reaching fast from the fleet down the West Channel. She
afterwards gave a fine display by the wind, and showed matchless form on
a dead run. 'Valkyrie' eventually beat 'Britannia' by 5 mins. 32 secs.,
and 'Satanita' by 16 mins. 4 secs., 'Calluna' and 'Iverna' both being
miles astern. 'Valkyrie's' was a good performance, but she was
distinctly lucky in getting the first of the wind, and she likewise was
kindly treated subsequently by Dame Fortune.</p>

<p>Rather singularly the Jubilee Regatta of the Royal Southern Club was
followed by the Jubilee of the Royal Mersey; but the latter meeting, on
June 24, did not open under such exhilarating influences as the Solent
gathering, particulars having just come to hand of the 'Victoria'
disaster in the Mediterranean, while the weather was dismally dull, and
a tearing north-north-west wind blowing. Consequent on the prevailing
stiff breeze an alternative course&mdash;three times round the Formby&mdash;had
been plotted off overnight&mdash;probably not, however, from any tender
consideration whether the racing vessels could cross the bar safely, the
anxiety more likely being in regard to the Committee-boat and her
freight. The inside course was named on the day, but, in spite of
foresight and precaution, the racing was disappointing. The 'Valkyrie,'
which had come round from Cowes with her mainsail an underdeck
passenger, could not get the sail bent owing to the rain and wind; then
'Calluna' got her anchor foul, and being 25 minutes late, did not
start. 'Britannia' alone was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>(p. 363)</span> near the line when the Blue Peter
came down, yet she lost 1 min. 50 secs., while 'Satanita' came 2 mins.
later, and 'Iverna' a minute after 'Satanita.' There was wind enough to
warrant second earings being hardened down, all topmasts were housed,
and with the tide flying to windward the ground was sidled over very
fast. The start meant victory&mdash;barring accidents&mdash;in beating out of the
narrow Mersey channel, and although 'Satanita' worked right up under
'Britannia,' she was kept safely pinned. There was a short jump of sea,
and the two new ships were giving a free display of the fore body,
smashing the tidal combers into blinding clouds of sea dust. 'Satanita'
had a rare drilling from 'Britannia,' and although she also ran the
faster, she could not get through in such a limited stretch of water.
Thus the game was played to the end, it being a flog out from New
Brighton to the Formby, and a run back each round. Had the 'Satanita'
got her opponent's start, she would probably have beaten the Prince of
Wales's cutter fully 5 mins., as in such a breeze she was clearly the
faster to windward. 'Iverna' was very soon done with, and at the finish
'Britannia' finished 2 mins. 19 secs. before 'Satanita.'</p>

<p>The Royal Northern Regatta opened on July 1 with a piping breeze strong
enough for slab reefs to be pulled down; before noon, however, jackyard
topsails were wanted, and calms and partial breezes made tiresome work
afterward, flukes being as plentiful as motes in a sunbeam. The
'Calluna' put in an appearance, and when viewed broadside on her big
sail-plan gave her quite an over-hatted look. 'Satanita,' 'Britannia,'
'Valkyrie,' and 'Iverna' all made their number, and the match commenced
in a rush of wind, 'Satanita' clearing out of Rothesay Bay faster than
any steamboat ever left it&mdash;perhaps a madder burst of reaching was never
seen. The Southampton boat was at the head of affairs for some time, but
after some fluking 'Valkyrie' led. At the end of the second round,
however, 'Satanita,' through a sheer slice of luck, got 3 mins. ahead of
'Britannia,' and as it was then 4.30 and clock calm in the Clyde, it
was thought the match would be stopped. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364"></a>(p. 364)</span> Committee, however,
wanted the distance done, and 'Britannia,' being the faster in light
airs, got home late in the evening 1 min. 49 secs, before 'Satanita,'
'Valkyrie,' which was nearly 20 mins. astern of the latter at the end of
the first round, getting in 1 min. 32 secs, after, and saving her time
for second prize. The 'Calluna's' wide wings did not seem to help her as
they should have done in flaws and catspaws.</p>

<p>The Mudhookers opened the ball on July 5 at Hunter's Quay, and a very
capital sailing programme was put forward by the exclusive 'forty' which
constitute the club, the leading event being a prize value 100<i>l.</i> for
big cutters. With 'Britannia' and 'Calluna' disabled, the affair
virtually resolved itself into a match between 'Valkyrie' and
'Satanita,' although the 'Iverna' was a starter. It was imperative that
the helmsmen should be amateurs, and Mr. W. G. Jameson shipped for the
day as timoneer of 'Satanita,' Lord Dunraven having Mr. George Watson to
relieve him on 'Valkyrie.' Starting with a free sheet in a smart breeze,
'Satanita' went away so fast that 'Valkyrie' looked likely to have a
stern chase; but the wind got baffling, in beating up the Firth from
Ascog 'Valkyrie' worked up, and off Dunoon, in standing off on port, she
had to come round under the lee bow of her rival. A wind-jamming trial
then followed, and 'Satanita' either sidled away and dropped down on
'Valkyrie,' or the latter ate up under her rival, as the end of
'Satanita's' gaff hooked 'Valkyrie's' topmast shrouds, and Lord
Dunraven's cutter was towed along for some minutes. After getting clear,
it was thought 'Valkyrie's' topmast was slightly sprung, and there were
cross protests at the finish of the round. A desperately close race was
sailed on the second turn round the course, and 'Satanita,' which was
only 27 secs. ahead at the finish, got beaten on time by 'Valkyrie.'
'Iverna' finished 26 secs. after the leader.</p>

<p>Amateur helmsmen were in request for the big ships on Clyde Corinthian
Club day, when the 'Britannia,' 'Valkyrie,' 'Satanita,' and 'Iverna'
responded to the starting gun. The weather was very uncertain, the
breezes being so light that only <span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365"></a>(p. 365)</span> one round of the course could
be sailed. 'Valkyrie' was the lucky ship as she rounded the Kilcreggan
flagboat, two and a half miles from the Commodore, last boat. Standing
off in the Firth, along the edge of a flaw, whilst her opponents were
lying becalmed, she tacked into a breezy lane, and, passing 'Iverna,'
'Satanita,' and 'Britannia' in turn, carried her way up to the line,
getting the winning gun 30 secs. before 'Britannia' struggled through,
and 2 mins. 15 secs. in advance of 'Satanita.' The 'Valkyrie' was
steered by her owner, the 'Britannia' by Mr. W. G. Jameson, and the
'Satanita' by Mr. R. Ure.</p>

<p>A more unfavourable racing day than that which opened the Royal Club
Regatta has never been experienced even on the unutterably fluky Firth.
Sudden spurts of wind, calms, a very long spell of what was quite a
deluge of rain, deafening thunder, blinding lightning and depressing
gloom, made up the sample of weather vouchsafed to the competitors
during the time that the 'sport' was progressing. The big cutters
mustered in full force, and had a light easterly breeze, which gave a
reach down the Clyde. Just before the start, 'Britannia' on the port
tack, with the wind pretty broad abeam, made 'Calluna,' which had run
down from the eastward with boom over the port side, come round; and
this was deemed cause for 'Calluna' to pursue a protest, on the ground
that a breach of the rules of the road had been committed. 'Valkyrie,'
too, made a mark of 'Britannia,' the latter getting the stem, and
sustaining damage to the port bulwarks aft and the taffrail. After an
unsatisfactory start, 'Britannia' and 'Satanita' went round the Ascog
mark together, but just as the latter was stepping out in style, and
apparently in first place, her bobstay pendant burst and the bowsprit
broke off short to the stem-head. Topsails had been shifted, as there
was a prospect of a strong breeze, but the outcome was a tempest without
a rattle of wind. 'Britannia' sailed in fine form, and simply lost her
opponents directly 'Satanita's' accident had put that boat out of the
way. It was a wretchedly poor time, however, and, thanks to not a
little good <span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366"></a>(p. 366)</span> fortune, 'Britannia' beat 'Valkyrie' by 41 mins. 40
secs., and 'Calluna' by 62 mins. 17 secs., while 'Iverna' gave up.
Protests were lodged against 'Britannia' on behalf of both 'Calluna' and
'Valkyrie.' The 'Calluna's' objection was considered, and about midnight
the Sailing Committee decided to disqualify the 'Britannia,' only one
witness, be it said, from the last-named vessel having been called.
There was really not a semblance of racing on the second day of the
Royal Clyde Regatta, which was the valedictory fixture in the so-called
'Clyde fortnight.' Flying chills and draughts out of every 'airt,' with
long spells of calm, kept the vessels hanging about the lower part of
the Firth until the shadows were well slanting eastward. An evening
breeze helped 'Valkyrie' home, but it took her nearly seven hours and a
half to cover one half the course, and she finished 54 mins. 9 secs.
before the 'Calluna,' 1 hr. 31 mins. 30 secs. before 'Britannia,' and
about 2 hrs. 40 mins. before 'Satanita,' the last named taking 10 hrs.
to cover 25 miles.</p>

<p>Inspiriting racing marked the opening of the Irish fixtures at Bangor,
and the Royal Ulster Regatta attracted all the big cutters. The wind was
fresh from the north-north-east, slab reefs were down in mainsails and
sharp-headed topsails set. A thrilling and eventful contest followed a
perfectly judged start, and 'Britannia,' 'Satanita,' and 'Valkyrie'
formed first flight in a plain sail round the Lough as far as the South
Briggs flagboat, where the last named lost her place through one of her
hands getting knocked overboard in a gybe. At the same mark in the
second round 'Britannia' got the inside turn, when the main boom had to
come over; but 'Satanita' at once began to luff, and with mainsheet
blocks together on both they went heading out in the Lough. Foot by foot
'Satanita' came up, off Ballyholme Bay she had ranged broad on the
weather-beam of her rival, and was thus able to claim room at the home
flagboat, which she luffed round with 5 secs. lead, and Jay then kept
her shooting almost as long as she would to keep weather berth.
'Britannia' unluckily got her mainsheet jammed, and as she could not in
consequence be sprung <span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368"></a>(p. 368)</span> to the wind&mdash;at once&mdash;so high as
'Satanita,' she dropped under the lee quarter, and got a severe
blanketing all the way up the Lough. The pair sailed an exciting match
round the rest of the course, and 'Satanita' travelling like a shooting
star reached home winner with 5 secs. in hand. It may be said that the
feat was accomplished in one third of the course, 16&frac12; miles, and that
she beat 'Britannia' 2 mins. 29 secs. in that distance, which was a very
high tribute indeed to 'Satanita's' speed. 'Calluna' finished 7 mins. 19
secs. after the winner. 'Valkyrie' never regained any of the time lost
in picking up the hand who got overboard.</p>

</div>

<p>The breeze steadied down during the dark hours, and the 'Valkyrie' had a
day just to her liking. 'Iverna's' well-known racing banner was missed
for the first time in the season, owing to her rudder-head being
twisted. Spectators were treated to a magnificent light-weather match
between the 'Valkyrie' and 'Britannia.' The former took the lead
directly after the flash of the starting gun, but she did not seem to
ghost along in the usual peerless style. 'Britannia' was with difficulty
kept pinned under the lee; in fact, it was evident that 'Valkyrie' could
not allow her opponent a cross-tacking chance, or her quarry would
certainly have slipped her. The breezes were paltry and patchy, with
plenty of white water spots about, and the course was shortened to the
extent of one third the distance, 'Valkyrie' eventually crawling home
winner about three lengths ahead of 'Britannia,' although there was 1
min. 56 secs. difference between them in time. 'Calluna's' big sail-plan
availed her little, and 'Satanita' never once really woke up in the
prevailing zephyrs. 'Calluna' finished 16 mins. 53 secs. astern of
'Valkyrie,' and 'Satanita' struggled in against the tide 8 mins. 6 secs.
after 'Calluna.'</p>

<p>There was a piping breeze from the westward on the opening day of the
Royal Irish Regatta, and a stirring struggle with 'Satanita,'
'Britannia,' and 'Calluna' for Her Majesty's Cup was accordingly
anticipated. 'Calluna' risked a whole mainsail, but 'Britannia' and
'Satanita' had the baby reef in and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369"></a>(p. 369)</span> all set jibheaded topsails.
Perfect judgment was shown on the 'Satanita' and 'Britannia' in
man&oelig;uvring for the start, but 'Satanita's' skipper scored first
honours as he gave his ship a wipe away at the nick of time, and she
reached through the line, fairly foaming a length ahead of the Prince of
Wales's cutter, 'Calluna' being about a hundred yards astern. They went
along the wind at a tearing pace to the Muglins Mark, jib-topsails being
cracked on, and on going to the Kish the wind was brought on the
quarter, a nasty roll tried spars and gear, and an ugly gybe came on
before making the Lightship. At this mark 'Satanita' had given a
startling illustration of her speed with a free sheet, as she led the
'Britannia' 2 mins. 5 secs., with 'Calluna' only 19 secs. astern of the
latter. A very fast piece of close reaching was done between the Kish
and the Rosebeg, then came a dead peg across the Bay. 'Britannia' tried
hard to get 'Satanita' into short tacking, and the latter, having to
turn about more often than suited her, found 'Britannia' settling up,
enabling 'Calluna' to profit by the game her opponents were playing. In
a hard squall the second round commenced, and through a backing of the
wind they had a run with spinnakers to the Kish. A gybe had to be made,
and it was a heavy one. 'Satanita' and 'Britannia' got their booms over
all right, but 'Calluna's' came in a hurry, and while the boom-end was
buried deep in the water, the inner part came with a surge against the
runner and broke off, the outer half of the spar launching in board and
lying square across the deck. Luckily no one was hurt, which was simply
a miracle. The 'Satanita' and 'Britannia' sailed a desperate race during
the rest of the round, and this time the former had the better of her
rival beating across the bay. In going free to the Kish on the last
turn, 'Satanita' sailed in peerless form, and had a lead of 4 mins. 44
secs. at the Lightship. In a close reach to the Rosebeg, 'Satanita' lost
a few seconds, and then followed a splendid race tack and tack home.
'Britannia' was the better on this point, but 'Satanita' kept her under
the lee and weathered the line with a lead of 2 mins. 47 secs., winning
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370"></a>(p. 370)</span> Royal trophy and scoring a brilliant victory with 69 secs.
to spare.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish Regatta finished on Thursday, July 20, in changeable
weather and baffling breezes. With 'Calluna' crippled, the 'Satanita'
and 'Britannia' had a match for the club prize, and not at all
unexpectedly 'Britannia' was winner. She scored by no means a bloodless
victory, and her crew had a scare when 'Satanita' struck into a breeze
about half water between the Muglins and Kish, and went streaking past
like a flash of greased lightning. 'Satanita' was pluckily sailed, but
had not wind enough to wake her up and, when the match was stopped at
the end of the second round, 'Britannia' had a lead of 4 mins. 4 secs.</p>

<p>'Navahoe,' 161-rater: N.Y.Y. Club (Royal Phelps Carroll,
Esq.)</p>
</div>

<p>Most auspicious was the opening of the Cowes racing week in regard to
wind and weather, there being every indication of the morning breeze of
Monday freshening when the stream bent westward, and of lasting sunshine
and a clear atmosphere. The match was under the Royal London burgee, and
the club had adopted a new course of which it may be said that a better
could not have been marked off inside the Isle of Wight. The big cutter
entry included the 'Valkyrie,' 'Britannia,' 'Satanita,' 'Calluna,'
'Iverna,' and the Gold Cup challenger 'Navahoe,' and there was general
rejoicing on the morning of the day that the American would be certain
to get a trustworthy test of speed in her first racing essay. Curiosity
to see how she would acquit herself under the circumstances ran high.
The match commenced with a free reach to the eastward on the back of a
fair tide, and the wind followed and gave a run, but it came in streaks
and the fleet were all together at the Warner, the 'Valkyrie' being
leader, with 'Navahoe' 75 secs. astern. A nice breeze was found to
windward, and in turning in to the Noman 'Valkyrie' worked away from the
Yankee and then went for 'Britannia,' which, with 'Satanita,' stood away
for the north shore. 'Valkyrie' was then left with 'Navahoe,' and the
latter along Ryde Sands and on to the Motherbank got more wind and a
slacker tide, inside 'Valkyrie,' and forereached so much <span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372"></a>(p. 372)</span> the
faster that on coming off she crossed comfortably ahead of Lord
Dunraven's cutter. 'Navahoe' performed this feat 'on her uppers,' while
'Valkyrie' was stiff as a tree, perhaps through having less wind than
there was to leeward. The breezes continued to be served out partially
in strength and direction, and 'Britannia,' 'Satanita,' and 'Calluna'
were having a bad time in working the north shore down. 'Valkyrie'
picked up 'Navahoe' in beating on to Calshot, and went round that mark
with just a clear lead. The breeze was unsteady and puffy in reaching to
Lepe, but for the most part sheets were checked, and 'Navahoe's' big
sail-plan dragged her by to windward of 'Valkyrie,' and she <span class="pagenum"><a id="page373" name="page373"></a>(p. 373)</span> was
first round Lepe buoy, but she made a wide sweep in the gybe and
'Valkyrie' ran on to the fore. With a leading wind 'Navahoe' slipped
through to leeward into first place before getting to Cowes, and thence
they squared away. 'Valkyrie' was not raced with the same spirit as
'Britannia' was on the first run eastward, or the 'Navahoe' would have
been luffed out into Spithead; the latter was, in fact, allowed to keep
the even tenour of her way, and she rounded the Warner with 10 secs.
lead of 'Valkyrie,' 'Britannia' having run up on both, while 'Satanita'
had taken the American in nearly 3 mins. With a weather tide and truer
and fresher breeze, they had a fair test to windward, and a couple of
boards sufficed for 'Valkyrie' and 'Britannia' to weather the American.
'Valkyrie' was sailed to bother 'Britannia,' while the 'Navahoe' was
fairly let run loose. Had the sister ships been simply sailing boat
against boat, they could not have carried on a keener duel. 'Britannia'
beat 'Valkyrie,' but instead of having a substantial lead at Calshot
Lightship, she was only just to windward of 'Valkyrie,' and but 1 min.
33 secs. ahead of 'Navahoe.' In reaching to Lepe, 'Britannia' and
'Valkyrie' gained in distance on the American, but nothing in time,
owing to the rushing lee-tide. There was a smart breeze to blow them
home against the boiling stream, and the 'Navahoe's' big sail-plan
helped her. Both 'Britannia' and 'Valkyrie,' however, kept to the fore,
and 'Britannia' finished winner of a hard race, 63 secs. ahead of
'Valkyrie,' 1 min. 23 secs. of 'Navahoe,' 3 mins. 50 secs. of
'Satanita,' and 7 mins. 36 secs. of 'Calluna.' It may be said that
'Satanita' gained 4 mins. 34 secs. and 'Calluna' 6 mins. 18 secs. on the
'Navahoe' in sailing the second round; the pair picked up on 'Britannia'
and 'Valkyrie' simply owing to the suicidal tactics adopted in racing
the sister ships.</p>

<p>A breeze was wanting on the opening morning of the Royal Yacht Squadron
Regatta to put animation in the scene afloat, still in the flood of
sunshine it was a brilliant spectacle. There was a galaxy of private
yachts, and quite a fleet of fighting ships of various nationalities
riding on the Solent dressed in bunting, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374"></a>(p. 374)</span> the German Emperor's
new 'Hohenzollern' looming up a very Triton amongst the host, through
which the racing fleet had presently to thread their way eastward. The
starters for Her Majesty's Cup were the 'Meteor,' 'Britannia,'
'Valkyrie,' 'Viking,' <i lang="fr">née</i> 'Wendur,' and 'Mohawk.' An alteration in the
course had been made by substituting the Bullock patch buoy for the Nab,
and with thoughtful consideration for the length of leg of the modern
craft, the three-fathom North Bramble Channel was left out. A dreadfully
slow run was made eastward, the 16&frac12; miles from Cowes to the eastern
limit of the course taking about 2&frac12; hours to cover. The breezes came
in puffs out of every cloud, but mostly from the north or north-west,
and in this sort of weather it was absolutely humiliating that the
aspirant for America Cup honours should be led round the lee mark by the
seven-season-old 'Meteor.' With a better and fairly true breeze westerly
'Valkyrie' and 'Britannia' on a close reach in to the Noman passed the
Emperor's cutter, and, from mark to mark eight miles, 'Valkyrie' beat
'Meteor' exactly 4 mins. After fetching well up to Cowes, they turned
through the roads, and then got a northerly slant in the west channel; a
flying weather-tide settled them bodily to windward, and at Lymington
mark 'Valkyrie,' which had gone in grand form to windward, was 3 mins.
ahead of 'Britannia' and 15 mins. 40 secs. of 'Meteor,' the time
allowance of the last named having thus run out by 68 secs. The wind was
breezing up, and they ran through a roaring ebb tide at a fair speed,
the modern boats pushing out a tremendous bow wave. The 'Meteor'
unquestionably had a stronger following breeze than the two leaders, and
with about 3&frac12; ft. less draught than 'Valkyrie,' she could be edged
inside the tide rift on the north shore, the result being that she
gained 50 secs. on 'Valkyrie,' yet with an allowance of 14 mins. 32
secs. she thus lost by 18 secs. On the question being raised that
'Valkyrie' had not followed the track marked on the official chart
furnished, it was admitted that she had left the Nab on the wrong hand,
and the Sailing Committee disqualified her and declared the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375"></a>(p. 375)</span>
'Meteor' winner of Her Majesty's Cup. It may be said that the 'Wendur'
after rounding Lymington mark attempted to set her spinnaker, but lost
the sail, which was picked up by a pilot boat. Worse still, the boom was
let drop in the water, and on it breaking two of the crew were badly
hurt.</p>

<p>Wednesday, August 2, was chosen by the Royal Yacht Squadron for the
match for the Meteor Challenge Shield presented by the German Emperor,
the course being from Cowes round the Isle of Wight (outside Nab),
thence round the Shambles Lightship and back through the Needles passage
to Cowes, a distance of 112 miles. According to the conditions four
yachts were to start or no race, but out of an entry of six only
'Britannia' and 'Satanita' went for the trophy. The start, which was
fixed for seven o'clock, was delayed an hour owing to the card and
sailing directions differing. At 8 o'clock, when 'Britannia' and
'Satanita' got away, the 'Valkyrie's' crew, which had made a show of
getting the vessel ready, had proceeded as far as hoisting a jib in
stops and lashing up the fighting colours, the vessel subsequently lying
listless at anchor all day. A charmingly bright clear morning with a
bonny breeze from the north-west sent the two ships scudding out in hot
haste to the eastward. Spinnakers were on and jackyard topsails, and at
the Nab 'Britannia' had run out a lead of 4 mins. Coming on a reach the
east stream was faced, and 'Satanita,' doing a wonderful stretch of
sailing, had almost drawn level with her rival, when the wind came ahead
and gave a beat of about forty miles to the Shambles. In order to shun
the tide the Island shore was worked, but 'Satanita' got too close and
bumped hard several times on Atherfield Ledge. In working on a nasty
short jump of sea was trying the vessels, and off Swanage the breeze
came in such hard puffs that big topsails were got down. 'Britannia'
worked away from her rival, and after a pretty considerable amount of
pile-driving got round the Shambles at 4 o'clock with a lead of 10 mins.
They had to face a west tide, and as the evening closed in the wind
almost entirely failed. In the west channel <span class="pagenum"><a id="page376" name="page376"></a>(p. 376)</span> it was mere
tide-work, and at 9.30 'Britannia' drove across the line winner,
'Satanita' at the time being barely discernible astern. It was an
uninteresting match, but a hard one for ships and crews, and in the
heavy plunging which went on between the Needles and St. Albans
'Britannia' sprung her mast.</p>

<p>Thursday morning opened with a fine singing breeze from the
west-south-west, and the match for the Cowes Town Cup gave promise of
stirring sport. 'Britannia's' absence, owing to her mast being sprung,
was generally regretted; but 'Navahoe,' 'Valkyrie,' 'Satanita,' and
'Calluna' appeared under fighting flags. All had a single reef in
mainsails, and 'Valkyrie's' topmast was struck, the rest keeping theirs
on end. They were sent first to the westward, and had a clean reach to
the first mark, a capitally judged start being made. 'Satanita,' nearest
the Hampshire shore, was first on the line, with 'Valkyrie' overlapping
the western quarter, and 'Calluna' and 'Navahoe' broad to windward.
Laying down to the hard breeze, 'Satanita' was given the weight of it,
and went smoking away, while 'Navahoe' in weather berth was getting
comparatively very lightly sailed. A hard breeze, however, caught the
Yankee, making her curl up to an ugly angle, and as she went off her
helm, 'Calluna's' crew were getting scared that she would either drop
down flat on them or make a wild shoot into their ship. A heavier slam
than the first put the 'Navahoe' fairly out of control, and she went
down on her side and wallowed helplessly in a smother of foam, until a
gripe up to the wind relieved her and she came upright, when particular
care was taken not to fill on her again. The weight of the wind had
burst the mainsail at the clew, and, after getting the sail off the
vessel ran away up Southampton Water, International rivalry thus coming
to a summary end for the day. Owing to the strong wind and flood tide,
the mark-boat had driven about a mile eastward, so it was soon reached
down to, and 'Satanita' was first round, then 'Valkyrie' and 'Calluna.'
It was a broad reach to the Warner, and cracking on a jibheaded topsail
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377"></a>(p. 377)</span> 'Satanita' was ploughing along at an astounding speed; in fact,
she was doing 14&frac12; knots when crossing the Admiralty mile. With a
jibheader on, the leader was leaving 'Valkyrie,' which had lost
'Calluna's' close company through the latter, when careening to a
squall, fouling the jibboom of the steam yacht 'Cleopatra,' the cutter
getting mainsail split and gaff broken. 'Satanita' stayed round the
Warner at 10.52, 1 min. 18 secs. before 'Valkyrie,' and the former had
the benefit of a reach back as far as Cowes. Heavy squalls came off the
Island, and 'Satanita' had lee decks full, 'Valkyrie' by comparison
standing up manfully. Owing to the flagboat drifting, they went round
Lepe buoy, and having to nip to fetch, 'Valkyrie' gained a trifle.
Coming back free, 'Satanita' was driven along with jibheader, and she
held a lead of 7&frac12; mins. at the Warner. The homeward track could be
laid clean full, and the wind coming off with canvas-splitting force,
'Satanita's' lee decks were washing like a porpoise's back, but she was
travelling at a tremendous speed and would have gone much faster and on
a more even keel had the topmast been struck. It was a wonderful display
of fast sailing on her part, as she finished 8 mins. 13 secs. before
'Valkyrie,' and covered the distance, 48 miles, allowing for the drifted
flagboat at Lepe, in 3 hrs. 40 mins. 50 secs., thus averaging a little
over 12&frac12; knots.</p>

<p>An exceedingly brilliant wind-up of an eventful regatta was made at
Cowes on Friday, August 4, when the Royal Yacht Squadron prize was
sailed round the Warner-Lepe course. The competitors were 'Satanita,'
'Valkyrie,' 'Calluna,' and 'Navahoe,' and they started on a short beat
down the west channel in a rising breeze from the west-south-west,
jibheaded topsails being set over whole mainsails. In the first board
'Navahoe' was weathered by each of her rivals, the Yankee being kept
hovering in the wind, instead of being made to feel the weight of it,
the previous day's experience perhaps being the cause. A heavy squall
with sheets of rain passed over before the Western mark-boat was
weathered, and they drove back to Cowes with spinnakers, all but the
Yankee being run on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page378" name="page378"></a>(p. 378)</span> the wrong gybe. From a run they came to a
free reach off Osborne, and went streaking out at a great pace to the
Warner, all except 'Satanita' cracking on jackyarders, but 'Valkyrie'
shifted back to jibheader off the Sandhead buoy. The latter kept pride
of place going east, but in coming back clean full the wind came off the
Island in savage puffs and 'Satanita' was racing up. A regular flame of
wind struck off above the Peel, and 'Satanita' went by the windward into
first place, leaving 'Valkyrie' fairly stuck up. 'Navahoe' and 'Calluna'
hung on to big topsails too long, the Yankee continuing whipper-in and
falling down flat on her side in the hardest of the gushes. 'Satanita,'
too, crabbed up badly, but did not heel to such an angle as 'Navahoe,'
and was always lively and manageable in the puffs; she also got up a
higher head of speed the fresher the wind piped. On the second round it
was harder driving between 'Satanita' and 'Valkyrie' than with 'Calluna'
and 'Navahoe,' and after the free reach to the Warner the first named
was 2 mins. 2 secs. ahead or 3 secs. short of her allowance. It was just
a clean reach from the Noman to Cowes, and some of the puffs came off
the Island with the rush of a white squall. 'Satanita' was knocked down
flatter than 'Valkyrie,' but she did not steady her speed, and finished
a splendidly fought and most exciting race with 2 mins. 9 secs. lead of
'Valkyrie,' 'Satanita' winning with 4 secs. to spare. 'Calluna' was 5
mins. 22 secs. astern of the winner, and 'Navahoe' 7 mins. 36 secs.</p>

1892. "Warner and Lymington Course".</p>
</div>

<p>Ill fortune has of late haunted each annual Saturday fixture of the
Royal Southampton Club, and that of August 5, instead of attracting the
fleet of heavy weights, was reduced to a match between the 'Navahoe' and
'Calluna.' The 'Britannia' had her new mast in, but was not ready,
'Satanita' was getting a strengthening band shrunk on her masthead, and
'Valkyrie,' which had come across from Cowes to Southampton Water, did
not start, fearing there would be too much wind for her sprung
main-boom. A north-wester came shooting down Southampton Water fresh
enough for 'Navahoe's' small reef to be pulled down, 'Calluna,'
however, had whole mainsail and both jibheaders. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380"></a>(p. 380)</span> The Scotch
clipper was unluckily sailed through the line too soon, and the
'Navahoe' got two minutes start; but 'Calluna' bringing quite a rattle
of wind, nearly nailed her rival at Calshot Spit. The breeze got light
in the west channel and came bare, while the tide had to be stemmed.
'Navahoe' kept sailing into the first of the wind, and, getting a fine
lift near the Lymington Mark, led by 3 mins. 'Calluna' was sailed
without heart or judgment in the run up the west channel, and so on to
the Warner. She might well have carried her jackyard topsail going west,
and certainly wanted it, coming back with sheets off. 'Calluna' was
gybed in Cowes Roads for some reason; and while her opponent was running
clean with boom the other side, the Scotch boat was 'by the lee.'
'Navahoe' at length was first to shift her big topsail, and had 6 mins.
lead at the time, but when 'Calluna' did go to work sail shifting, it
took her crew eighteen minutes to get down the jibheaded topsail and
replace it with jackyarder. In the beat from the Warner up past
Browndown there were some flukes lying under the north shore which might
have been picked up for the seeking, and 'Calluna's' poor attempt at
match sailing ended by 'Navahoe' weathering the line off Netley with a
lead of 11 mins. 25 secs.</p>

<p>The racing fleet mustered in force on the Royal Albert Station, and
cruisers swarmed thick as bees to do honour to the last of the Solent
racing fixtures. A light gauzy haze in the early morning of Monday,
August 14, did not bode well for sport, but an air came just before the
starting hour for the Albert Cup, and stretched out the fighting flags
of 'Britannia,' 'Navahoe,' 'Calluna,' and 'Satanita.' A south-east
breeze of about weight enough for small jib-topsails to be carried with
profit to windward was drawing in against the last of the east-going
stream, when an eventful race commenced with 'Satanita's' bowsprit end
showing first across the line; the others were close at hand, and a
pretty start was made.</p>

1892.</p>
</div>

<p>The wind freshened at night after Weymouth Regatta, and on Sunday
morning there was an ugly sea off the Bill. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382"></a>(p. 382)</span> yachts which
made the passage to Torquay had a coarse time, some of them ran back,
others did not leave the Dorset port, the consequence being that there
was a poor muster in Torbay. The 'Satanita,' 'Navahoe,' 'Britannia,' and
'Calluna' were ready to answer the starting gun on Monday morning when
the wind was piping loud from the westward. All had a reef in mainsails,
and topmasts were housed when anchors were broken out, but 'Satanita's'
was very unwisely got on end, and she subsequently set a jibheader.
'Satanita,' over-eager, sailed the line too soon, and her opponents had
been racing for the off mark nearly 3 mins. before she followed them
across. With the wind quarterly, she soon smoked out to the first
flagboat, where 'Navahoe' was leader and 'Calluna' second. Then came a
beat in a little head jump, and the full drift of the wind was felt.
'Navahoe's' performance in beating to Brixham was far and away her worst
display, as she simply crabbed on her uppers and sidled away, while
'Satanita,' crippled as she was with jibheader, was&mdash;truth to tell&mdash;not
shaping a whit better, and seemed to be simply wallowing in dead water.
Off Brixham, 'Satanita' had another set back, through one of her extra
hands slipping overboard, but a very smart job was made in picking the
man up. 'Satanita' was punished with jibheader again on the second
round, and 'Britannia,' 'Calluna,' and 'Navahoe' were waltzing away from
her. On the third round the sail was pulled down and the spar housed,
but it was too late in the day to pick up the first flight. 'Satanita,'
however, began to tramp away, and in addition to reaching her rivals
beat the lot going to windward. The wind fairly whistled off shore as
they reached on for Goodrington, but 'Calluna' and 'Navahoe' did not
lower staysails as on the second round. The 'Britannia's' jib, however,
burst, and 'Navahoe' shifted hers. The latter was in the way of a
regular canvas splitter as she kept away round the Goodrington mark, and
falling down flat she swept the mark-boat with her mainsail, but
continued the match. At the end of the third round 'Navahoe' was 8 mins.
astern of 'Britannia,' and 4 mins. of 'Calluna,' while 'Satanita' had
gained 4 mins. on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384"></a>(p. 384)</span> the Yankee in 10 miles. The 'Navahoe's'
mainsail was found to be damaged at the clew, and to be giving out at
the reef lacing, and just as 'Satanita' was collaring her off the
Imperial she drew to the wind and gave up. On the last round 'Satanita'
gained 1 min. 42 secs. on 'Britannia,' the latter finishing an easy
winner 4 mins. 30 secs. ahead of 'Calluna,' and 7 mins. 9 secs. of
'Satanita.'</p>

</div>

<p>The wind hardened during the dark hours, and was blowing a moderate gale
from the south-west at sunrise. It had veered westerly and moderated a
little an hour before the start, and the 'Britannia,' 'Calluna,' and
'Satanita' housed topmasts, got first reef in mainsails, and set third
jibs in anticipation of a dusting. 'Navahoe' could not start, owing to
her damaged mainsail; but had she joined in there is no reason to
suppose that she would have shaped better than on the previous day, as
the wind was about the same in strength and direction, and the course
almost identical. 'Britannia' and 'Satanita' made a grand start, but
with the wind abaft the beam the latter cleared out at once from under
her rival's lee, and gave a really phenomenal display of speed going to
the flagboat outside Hope's Nose, covering the distance in 13 mins. 50
secs. She was at the mark in the thick of a passing squall, and when the
tiller was put down to bring her by the wind it broke off close into the
rudder-head, Jay, who always steers from the lee side, being just saved
from going overboard. The mishap was alike annoying to crew and
spectators as the vessel would, without doubt, have established a record
over the Torbay course. The 'Britannia' and 'Calluna' then had a match,
and, curious to state, 'Calluna' in the hard wind which prevailed during
the first, second, and third rounds, fairly beat 'Britannia' on each
turn while sailing with a free sheet, the advantage gained by the latter
being on the beat between the sea mark and Brixham. On the last round
the wind took off a little and 'Britannia' made an all-round gain,
eventually beating her antagonist by 4 mins. 17 secs.</p>

<p>In contrast to the tearing pipe-up at Torquay, variable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page385" name="page385"></a>(p. 385)</span>
breezes, flaws, catspaws, and calms prevailed in Start Bay when the
Royal Dart matches were decided. Owing to the death of the Duke of
Coburg the 'Britannia' did not start, but 'Navahoe' was under racing
colours again, and she was opposed by 'Calluna' and 'Satanita,' Mr.
Crocker, of New York, having arrived just in time to sail the American.
All light kites were set, and 'Satanita' led the race on a reach to the
Skerries buoy, at which mark 'Navahoe' was whipper-in. 'Calluna,'
through luffing out to cover 'Satanita,' let 'Navahoe' through into
second place, and the latter ran up close to the leader. The breeze got
so soft that they could hardly gain on the tide, and getting a flaw
first on one quarter and then on the other positions kept changing, till
at the last mark 'Satanita' was just clear ahead of 'Calluna'; the tide,
however, hooked the latter and set her on to the mark-boat, and she at
once gave up. 'Satanita' and 'Navahoe' reached along in a trickling air
with all light kites set, and 'Satanita' finished the first round with a
lead of 1 min. 18 secs. Both got in the doldrums near the Start mark,
but taking a chill 'Navahoe' got away with a long lead. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page386" name="page386"></a>(p. 386)</span>
'Satanita,' however, brought enough wind to drag her by to windward, and
give her a good lead at the east mark. 'Satanita' was lucky enough to
get a new wind first, which kept pretty true and steady afterward, and
she eventually beat 'Navahoe' in a fluky race by 7 mins. 45 secs.</p>

<p>The rising Start Bay Club, to its credit be it said, catered for the big
ships, and in return secured the entry of the familiar quartet. After a
breathless morning an opportune breeze from the south-east travelled in
from sea and put a little life into the start. The 'Satanita,' however,
had just before drove on to the outer flagboat and she was then kept
lying with staysail to windward. 'Navahoe' crossed the line first, and
in a soft breeze went clean full and by for the Torcross flagboat,
'Britannia' and 'Calluna' being sailed finer. 'Satanita,' when told by
the Committee to 'go on,' crossed the line 11 mins. 20 secs. after
'Navahoe,' and getting a better breeze than the leaders she gained about
7 mins. on 'Navahoe.' The last named went stealing along in the gentle
breeze and finished the first round 33 seconds before 'Britannia.' The
breeze freshened and they came on a taut bowline, and after 'Navahoe'
had tried her best to wind 'Britannia,' the latter squeezed through her
lee and in the next board crossed ahead, while 'Satanita' closed up.
After a run from the west to east mark, they had a broad reach home in a
fine breeze, 'Britannia' keeping bell-wether. 'Navahoe' held second
place in the beat to Torcross, but 'Satanita' went past in going down
wind for the next mark. It was a curious finish, as after reaching in
fairly foaming, the wind cut off within a quarter of a mile of the
winning line, and 'Britannia' came upright. She then got a cyclonic
cooler, which filled the lower sails one way and the topsail the other.
'Britannia's' long lead looked likely to be wiped out, as the
'Satanita,' 'Navahoe,' and 'Calluna' were meanwhile tearing in foaming.
They in turn got stuck up, however, in the same vortex, and 'Britannia'
was logged winner with a lead of 7 mins. 16 secs. of 'Satanita,' 9 mins.
20 secs. of 'Navahoe,' and 12 mins. 44 secs. of 'Calluna.' 'Satanita's'
was a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page388" name="page388"></a>(p. 388)</span> remarkably fine performance in such weather; but, after
all, she had a bootless journey, the 'Navahoe' taking second prize.</p>

<p>The 'Navahoe' did not go further west than Dartmouth, but gave
topsail-sheet for Cowes to get her wings clipped and a thorough brush up
before the Gold Cup and other challenge cup matches with 'Britannia.'</p>

<p>Had the matches for the Royal Victoria Gold Cup been set for decision
earlier in the season, and the challenger and defender not previously
gauged their speed, deeper and wider interest would very naturally have
been taken in the contests. As matters stood, the result appeared a
foregone conclusion, yet many were warned by the 'Navahoe's' admirers
that a little clipping and other alterations would be found to have
wrought an improvement both in stability and speed, and that she would
make a closer fight than was generally anticipated. The club
arrangements for the first match of the series, on Wednesday, Sept. 6,
appeared to be as perfect as possible, and excitement ran high on the
morning of the day. There was a great crowd on Ryde Pier, and the
official steamer which embarked ticket-holders at Southampton, Cowes,
Ryde, and Southsea carried a large and critical company.</p>

<p>Friday was appointed for the final match over the long Victoria course,
and it turned out a very coarse time, the wind coming in tearing squalls
and the rain in sheets. 'Navahoe's' mainsail gave out at the eyelet
lacings, and the second reef was got down, the start meanwhile being
delayed. The American, however, eventually brought up, and Mr. Jameson,
who was acting for the Prince of Wales on the 'Britannia,' declined,
under the circumstances, to take advantage of a 'sail over,' it being
mutually agreed subsequently to race on Monday. Monday opened with a
rattling breeze from the eastward, but it had toned down at 11 o'clock,
and was then a typical time to test the rivals under lower canvas with
mainsails single reefed. As usual with the wind out there was a tumble
of sea off Spithead. They started to the eastward at 11.5, and had a
beat to the Nab, 'Britannia' having the best of it, as she was broad to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390"></a>(p. 390)</span> windward at the flash of the gun. The west tide was going, and
a long stretch was made across Spithead, 'Britannia' giving her rival a
blistering for a time. She was too far ahead off the Warner to be
spilling 'Navahoe's' head-sail, and, smashing through the short sea in
peerless style, beat the American 9 mins. 5 secs.&mdash;or a minute a
mile&mdash;turning to the Nab. Spinnakers Irish-reefed and hoisted to
masthead were set after they had reached on to the Spit mark, and a gybe
was made off Lee, the western flag being tacked round, and here
'Britannia' led by 9 mins. 7 secs. 'Navahoe' after rounding appeared to
be starved for wind, while 'Britannia' was getting rammed along. Soon
the jibsheets of the American ran out, and the sail had to be secured,
sheets rove, and the sail reset, 'Britannia' meanwhile having hopped a
long distance away; and she weathered the home flagboat and finished the
first round with a lead of 17 mins. 7 secs. The Nab was turned to in a
lighter breeze and smoother water, and 'Navahoe,' getting a northerly
slant when off the Elbow buoy of the Dean, made a long leg out, while
'Britannia' had been pegging away at short turnings. The latter,
however, weathered the lightship holding a lead of 14 mins. 5 secs., and
she only added 10 secs. in going free to the western mark. The wind
having backed to the eastward, they could lay clean for home, and with a
fair tide the ground was covered very fast. 'Britannia's' masthead had
gone aft, and the heel of her housed topmast was sticking out so far
that it had torn the staysail just inside the tabling, and the sail
split up from foot to head just before she crossed the line victorious
in her defence of the Royal Victoria Gold Cup. The 'Britannia' finished
at 4 hrs. 29 mins. 17 secs., and 'Navahoe' at 4 hrs. 44 mins. 25 secs.</p>

<p>After having finished the deciding match for the Royal Victoria Gold
Cup, conqueror and conquered sailed away westward and rode the night out
at anchor in Cowes Roads. Tuesday, Sept. 12, was fixed for the race for
the Brenton Reef Cup, and it turned out a bright crisp morning, with a
fine singing breeze easterly, and, gauged by the loom on the seascape,
it appeared <span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391"></a>(p. 391)</span> probable the wind would prevail from that quarter.
According to conditions the course was from off the Needles Rocks round
Cherbourg breakwater, passing in at the west end and out at the east,
and returning to the Needles, the distance being computed at 120 miles.
The antagonists were towed away after breakfast to the rendezvous, and
going down the west channel a reef was put in mainsails, No. 3 jibs
hoisted in stops, and flying jibs stowed at bowsprit ends, while
jibheaded topsails were set after the last pull had been taken at
purchases. The owner of the 'Navahoe's' wish that 5 mins. be allowed for
crossing the line and the difference corrected at the finish of the
match was acceded to, and about 11.30 the official steamer was in
position, Mr. R. Grant, secretary of the Royal Yacht Squadron, being
officer in charge. The imaginary starting line was formed by bringing
the three Needles Rocks in one, and at noon the Blue Peter was lowered
and the match commenced. 'Britannia' reached across the line at 12 hrs.
1 min. 6 secs. <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, the 'Navahoe' at 12 hrs. 2 mins. 5 secs., the
Prince of Wales's cutter thus having 54&frac12; secs. to allow at the
finish. Sheets were trimmed for a beam wind, and with flying jibs and
balloon staysails set they went racing fast across the down-coming ebb.
There was a nasty ground swell, and on getting clear from under the lee
of the land the full weight of the wind was felt, the sea getting
crested and heavy. Jibheaders were handed, flying jibs lowered, and
working staysails set, and travelling upwards of twelve knots there was
plenty of drift knocking about. 'Britannia' continued to keep 'Navahoe'
astern, and two hours after the start 25 miles had been logged. The wind
kept true and they continued to sail a punishing race, the vessels
labouring a good deal in the lumpy sea, and yawing in all directions.
Keeping up an even speed of about twelve knots, they made the breakwater
about four and a half hours after the start, and up to this time
'Britannia' had kept her lead. When about five miles off, 'Navahoe' was
let come up sharp across the leader's wake, and, making a shoot
afterward off her helm, she looked like coming in to her opponent.
'Britannia' dropped back <span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392"></a>(p. 392)</span> after being thus covered up, and then
came into her rival's wake, and they raced on into the comparative
smoothing under the land, with 'Navahoe' holding a few lengths lead.
Topmasts were housed, and they passed into the breakwater ready for the
two-miles beat through Cherbourg Roads. This was at 5 o'clock, and
'Navahoe' had a lead of 25 secs. 'Britannia' drew to close round the
buoy, 'Navahoe' found her opponent beating out broad on her weather, and
in the first board 'Britannia' held a clear lead. In the last tack
'Britannia' stood on until she could spoil her opponent, and it took
'Navahoe' a few minutes to recover the winding. 'Britannia' headed out
of the eastern end with about 2 mins. lead, and on getting in the open
the ebb was still going west. It was a clean fetch back, but the wind
was heavier and the sea steeper than on coming over. When night closed
in they were about half-way across Channel, the vessels then getting
fearfully punished. They raced together, however, in a wonderful way,
'Britannia' keeping the lead, with 'Navahoe' about 150 yards astern, the
latter running wildly about, pointing one minute wide of the leader's
weather quarter and anon for the lee side. Foresails had with difficulty
been lowered when the vessels were about two miles off the breakwater,
but with the wind more moderate, when they were about five miles off St.
Catherine's they were reset. The flood tide was streaming hard, but
'Britannia' on closing in to the Needles was hauled up a bit for fear
the wind should draw off the land, while 'Navahoe' was sailed hard along
and closed on the leader. As the club steamer could not be anchored in
the fairway outside the Needles, she was brought into Alum Bay and
moored, and according to official timing 'Britannia' showed 'on' with
the Needles Light at 10 hrs. 37 mins. 35 secs. <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, the 'Navahoe' at 10
hrs. 38 mins. 32 secs., 'Britannia' thus being winner on corrected time
by 2&frac12; secs. Mr. Carroll protested that the judge's steamer was not in
position, and that the difference between the vessels at the finish was
not so much as 57 secs. A meeting of the Royal Yacht Squadron Sailing
Committee was called, and it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page393" name="page393"></a>(p. 393)</span> was decided to adjudge 'Navahoe'
winner. It need hardly be said that this ruling was thought hard on
'Britannia' after such a grand race, and no explanation of the finding
was forthcoming. It was understood that the owner of the 'Navahoe' would
not agree to the match being re-sailed.</p>

<p>It was arranged to sail for the Cape May Cup on Friday, Sept. 15, under
precisely similar conditions to those which governed the Brenton Reef
Cup, and over the same course. In order to obviate any difficulty about
timing in the dark, it was agreed that the start and finish should be
from Alum Bay, and Col. J. Sterling undertook the duties of starter and
time-keeper. Seven o'clock was named for a beginning, but the vessels
could not move out of Cowes Roads until 9.30, owing to a dense fog
choking up the west channel.</p>

<p>On getting down to Alum Bay a further wait had to be made, owing to a
glass calm prevailing, and it was not until 12.30 that the preparatory
flag was broken out. There was a soft westerly breeze at the time, which
gave a short beat out to the Needles. Fine generalship was displayed on
'Britannia,' which was intentionally sailed through the line before the
gun, and 'Navahoe' was allowed the honour of showing the way.
'Britannia' followed 10 secs. later, and on meeting 'Navahoe' standing
off on port tack put her round, and presently stayed dead in her wind.
'Navahoe' got a terrible shake-off, and was 2&frac12; mins. astern at the
Needles. They then had a close reach off into the Channel, and with the
light breeze narrowing only slow progress was made. An hour and a half
after the start 'Britannia' held a lead of about a mile, and at 7
o'clock she was judged to be three miles ahead. At 8 o'clock there was
not a breath of wind, the vessels laid in a perfect calm for about two
hours, and it was reckoned that 'Britannia' was then about twenty miles
off the Wight. At 10.15 a north-east breeze gathered in, 'Britannia' ran
away with it, and in the pitchy darkness 'Navahoe' could not be made
out.</p>

<p>The breeze kept up, and the spinnaker was carried on 'Britannia' until
Cape Barfleur lights were made out right ahead. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page394" name="page394"></a>(p. 394)</span> Owing to an
alteration in the character of the lights not being noticed on the chart
for a time, it was thought 'Britannia' was too far to the westward, the
spinnaker was then got off, and the vessel hauled up a little. The
western end was made in the grey of the morning, and on entering at 5.29
'Britannia' was holding about three miles lead, but 'Navahoe' was
closing up fast. The wind was drawing through Cherbourg Roads, a few
boards were made to get weathering distance of the east end, and
'Britannia' was going out at the one end while 'Navahoe' was about
entering at the other, the distance between them being a trifle over two
miles. The breeze, which came from the northward by east, was growing,
and jib topsails were pulled down when about ten miles off. 'Britannia'
was sailed to keep her opponent fair in her wake, and she might have
been made fetch Christchurch head, but Durleston was the landfall, and
the leader tacked off the Dorset headland at 10.15, 'Navahoe' following
at 10.45. It was a beat hence home with a weather tide, and 'Britannia'
at this game made a terrible exhibition of her opponent, weathering the
line winner of the Cape May Cup with a lead of 36 mins. 13 secs. The
official timing was, 'Britannia' 12 hrs. 57 mins. 19 secs. <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
'Navahoe' 1 hr. 33 mins. 32 secs. <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> It may be said that 'Britannia's'
sail-area in the Gold Cup, Brenton Reef, and Cape May races was 10,327
square feet, and the 'Navahoe's' 10,815 square feet, the latter having
been clipped to the extent of 270 feet.</p>

<p>In summing up this review it may be said there is little reason to doubt
that the 'Britannia' was the best all round vessel of the fleet; the
'Valkyrie' was a trifle the quicker in stays and in light breezes, the
better vessel to windward, or even on a long close reach, and also in a
dead run. In hard winds and plain sailing the 'Satanita's' 10 ft.
greater length on the load-line gave her the mastery over the Prince of
Wales's cutter, but on any point and in any weather 'Britannia' was
equal to lowering the 'Calluna's' colours. The 'Britannia' and 'Navahoe'
were desperately close matched whenever the latter could get a broad
reach or run and keep the lee rail out <span class="pagenum"><a id="page395" name="page395"></a>(p. 395)</span> of water, but the Prince
of Wales's cutter was immeasurably her superior on the all-important
point&mdash;going to windward. Perfect handling contributed not a little to
'Britannia's' success, and, sailed as she was by John Carter and Mr. W.
G. Jameson, it is certain nothing was given away or lost. She had a
peerless record in her class&mdash;namely, 33 prizes in 43 starts; the gross
value of the prizes won, including challenge cups, being in round
numbers 2,500<i>l.</i></p>

<p>It must have been highly gratifying to the 'Valkyrie's' designer that
the vessel excelled in the very weather and sailing points
desired&mdash;namely, going to windward and dead running. Her trials with
'Britannia' showed how wonderfully evenly matched the vessels were in
moderate weather, and artistic handling was always conspicuous whenever
Lord Dunraven's cutter was under a racing flag. 'Valkyrie' made her mark
in the short season she had in home waters, her record being 15 prizes
in 24 starts, her winnings amounting to 955<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The 'Satanita' was a particularly unlucky boat, and on the Clyde her ill
fortune passed into a proverb. After breaking the spell with a victory
in Belfast Lough, she, however, scored several notable victories, and it
was a great feat to win two events at a Royal Yacht Squadron regatta.
Her fastest reaching display was no doubt in the Nore to Dover race, but
for a short burst the speed she attained in going from the New Pier,
Torquay, to the flagboat outside Hope's Nose has perhaps never been
equalled by anything of yacht kind. 'Satanita' was not such a handy boat
to get round marks or herring-bone through a crowded roadstead as
'Britannia' and 'Valkyrie,' but Jay is deserving of the highest praise
for the able way he sailed his charge. 'Satanita's' winnings included a
Queen's Cup and the Albert Cup, and in 36 starts she won 13 prizes,
value 760<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The 'Calluna' was a disappointing boat; indeed, her designer got into a
way at last of calling her 'My unlucky boat,' for which expression there
was all-sufficient reason. The best of 'Calluna' perhaps remains to be
got out of her, yet she went <span class="pagenum"><a id="page396" name="page396"></a>(p. 396)</span> by fits and starts in a wonderful
way, but could rarely maintain her form to a finish. She had very strong
opposition in 'Britannia,' 'Valkyrie,' and 'Satanita,' but likely enough
she would have been an all-round better boat, and perhaps a real flier,
with 2&frac12; ft. less beam and 2&frac12; ft. more load-water length. Her
skipper, A. Hogarth, is exceptionally smart in handling a small craft;
'Calluna' was his first charge of the heavy-weight line, and she
certainly was not the sort of craft to serve an apprenticeship in. The
Clyde cutter managed to win 10 prizes in 36 starts, but it was only on
two occasions that she sailed home in the van.</p>

<p>To small details in a racing vessel's outfit the Americans give much
more consideration than British yachtsmen think necessary. Many a
wrinkle might have been picked up, however, in making a careful study of
the 'Navahoe's' outfit, and there is no doubt that much of the gear and
ironwork in English yachts is too heavy. 'Navahoe's' failing was want of
stability, and this was found out on the other side before she set out
from home. Her iron skin was not in her favour, and we, on this side,
have yet to learn that a vessel can be properly laid on a wind when
steered with a wheel. The 'Navahoe' started 18 times and won 6 prizes.
Including the Brenton Reef Challenge Cup, her gross winnings amounted to
445<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The record of broken masts and other spars in connection with
first-class vessels was a remarkable one. It is likely that poor quality
wood brought about the majority of the breakages; in fact, last season's
spars were a rank bad lot. The case was different in 'Thistle's' year,
that vessel having a really splendid lot of sticks. It may be said that
the 'Britannia' had no fewer than three masts in her forty-three racing
essays, one topmast, two bowsprits, and one gaff; 'Calluna' two masts,
one main boom, and one gaff; 'Valkyrie' one mast, one topmast, one boom,
and one bowsprit; and 'Satanita' one bowsprit and one boom.</p>

<p>Referring to the 40-rating class, it was feared at the outset of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page397" name="page397"></a>(p. 397)</span> the season that neither 'Lais' nor 'Vendetta' was any
improvement on the over-year 'Varuna.' The last named had quite a
triumphal march at the outset, winning four class matches right off. It
was at Lowestoft that 'Lais' first gave 'Varuna' a taste of her quality,
as she beat the latter by 13 mins. 34 secs. in moderate weather. 'Lais'
was afterwards victorious at Dover, Southampton (R. Southern), Largs
Regatta, Royal Western of Scotland, Mudhook, Royal Ulster, Royal Irish,
Royal Alfred, Royal Yacht Squadron (Australian Cup), Royal Victoria.
Altogether she made up a string of 29 prizes in 39 starts, and the gross
value of her winnings was 827<i>l.</i> 'Varuna' gained first honours in the
Royal London match (Thames), Brightlingsea Regatta, Royal Harwich (both
days), Royal Mersey (both days), Royal Clyde, Royal Ulster, Royal
Cornwall (S.O.), Royal Southampton (2), Royal Albert (2), Royal Dart,
and Royal Western, her winning total being 23 prizes in 40 starts, value
605<i>l.</i> The 'Vendetta' won her maiden race, and only one more (R.
Southern), before leaving the Channel. She was an improved boat when she
joined in on the Clyde and won round the Royal Northern course, and she
was subsequently to the fore in the Clyde Corinthian Regatta, Royal
Clyde, Royal Irish, Royal London (Cowes), Royal Yacht Squadron, Royal
Dorset and Torbay (2). In all she gained 18 flags in 33, and the value
of her prizes amounted to 490<i>l.</i> The 'Thalia' only carried Judge Boyd's
colours ten times, and won six prizes, value 150<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The 'Dragon III.' was crack of the 20-rating class, and she had a very
brilliant record&mdash;namely, 31 prizes, value 445<i>l.</i>, in 34 starts. The
'Dragon' did not go through the season without a little doctoring, her
formidable opponent, the 'Deirdré,' being found very hard to beat after
being shortened about 10 in. on the water-line, and getting 45 square
feet more sail-area; so 'Dragon' was altered in like manner, and
'Deirdré' had again to take second place. The new 'Vigorna' was a
failure, and 'Dragon' and 'Deirdré' were too good for the 'Molly'
('Dragon II.'). The 'Zinita' would perhaps have proved equal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page398" name="page398"></a>(p. 398)</span>
to tackling the 'Dragon III.' by the wind, but Mr. Hill's boat would
certainly have been able to score heavily with checked sheets.
'Deirdré's' record was 21 prizes in 35 starts, and the 'Zinita's' 18 in
24 starts. The 'Phantom' was the crack of the tens, with 14 prizes in 24
starts; and the 5-rater 'Red Lancer' in going round the coast managed to
win 24 flags in 34 racing essays.</p>

<p>This review would not be complete without some reference to sails, and
it may be said that those made by the joint firms of Laphorn and Ratsey
were really wonderful and perfect specimens of the art. Still,
'Valkyrie's' canvas elicited the greatest praise in America, and
especially from General Paine, who said her suit 'fitted like a glove;
the most perfect canvas <span class="pagenum"><a id="page399" name="page399"></a>(p. 399)</span> he had ever seen in America.' The
quality of the material and workmanship was strikingly evident in
'Britannia's' mainsail, which lasted a season through, and after all the
fagging and rough work it had, it kept its shape to the end of the
season. The 'Valkyrie' had a mainsail made of Sea Island cotton for the
America Cup matches, but most people would vote flax good enough after
seeing such a sail as 'Britannia's.' The 'Satanita,' 'Calluna,' and
'Valkyrie's' mainsails stood equally well as 'Britannia's,' and those of
the 40-raters 'Lais' and 'Vendetta' could not have been better. The
twenties were quite as well done by; but the plan of giving the
last-named class wide cloths in a measure spoils the beauty of the
sails. The patent jibs introduced by T. Ratsey were very pretty sails,
but they seemed liable to go across the diagonal seam in a gusty wind.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE AMERICAN YACHTING SEASON OF 1893</span><br>
<span class="smcap">By Lewis Herreshoff</span></h2>

<p>The yachting season of 1893 was inaugurated by the laying of 'Navahoe's'
keel in the autumn of 1892, at the construction shops of the Herreshoff
Company, in Bristol, R.I.</p>

<p>Interest was soon centred in her, for it was clear that she was intended
for some unusual service, and when her owner Mr. R. P. Carroll,
announced his programme for the season of 1893, of going to England to
try for the American cups there, and to take part in what racing he
might, there was an astonishing awakening of enthusiasm on both sides of
the Atlantic, which culminated in the international contest off New York
in October 1893, that being without question the most exciting and
interesting series of races ever witnessed. Early in December 1892 the
challenge from Lord Dunraven was finally settled and adjusted, creating
a patriotic ardour in all English and American yachtsmen.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously the 'Valkyrie,' 'Britannia,' 'Calluna,' and
'Satanita' in England, and 'Colonia,' 'Vigilant,' 'Jubilee,' and
'Pilgrim' in America, were begun, the last three English yachts being
expressly intended to defend the American and other trophies against the
attack of 'Navahoe,' as well as more fully to test the value of
'Valkyrie,' on which rested the herculean task of returning the America
Cup to its native shores. The early months of 1893 were spent by the
yachting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page401" name="page401"></a>(p. 401)</span> circles of both England and America in discussions on
and comparisons of the merits of their favourite design and
construction, rig and so forth.</p>

<p>All attempts by the designers and builders to keep their work secret
were utterly futile, for all essential information as to dimensions and
chief characteristics found their way into the newspapers, giving zest
to the public interest and discomfiture to the builders, who set seals
on the mouths of their workmen and watchmen, and blocked every door and
window where the prying public might steal a view of the coming wonder;
but seals and watchmen could not evade the desire to know what was to be
the form and outline of the 'Defenders,' as the American yachts were
popularly called. The table on p. 402 gives important information
concerning the five American yachts of 1893, to which is added
'Valkyrie,' her dimensions being important for comparison with the
American vessels. 'Navahoe' was built under restrictions that precluded
all expectations of attaining the highest speed; she was intended for a
cruiser which in the event of necessity could be rigged and sailed so as
to make a good show with yachts then in existence. Her performance in
English waters, although disappointing, was but little below the
anticipations of those who knew her and understood the value of her
opponents, whose lines were not drawn when 'Navahoe' was begun.</p>

<p>The yachts 'Navahoe,' 'Colonia,' and 'Vigilant' are all after the type
of 'Gloriana' and 'Wasp,' but differing widely in some points, the first
and last being centreboard vessels, and 'Colonia' a keel, but of not
sufficient lateral plane, rendering her windward work faulty.</p>

<p>'Vigilant' represents perhaps more nearly than the others the so-called
American type; she combines a broad beam with good depth, and with her
centreboard down draws about 23 ft.</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of her construction is the employment of Tobin
bronze for her plating (save the upper row of plates, which are of
steel), and her centreboard, also of bronze, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page403" name="page403"></a>(p. 403)</span> is made of two
plates set apart with ribs between, the space of 2&frac12; in. being filled
with cement; the structure weighing 7,750 lbs., and being operated from
the cabin by means of differential lifts, capable of raising 6 tons.</p>

<p>'Jubilee' is of unusual design and construction; her body is wide and
shallow, with a fin attachment carrying about 40 tons of lead at a depth
of 13 ft. below the water's surface, and to increase the lateral plane
she has a centreboard that works through the fin and its bulb of lead,
exposing surface enough to ensure most excellent windward work, dropping
about 8 or 10 ft. below the bulb. 'Pilgrim' is an out-and-out fin-keel
yacht, the largest vessel of that type ever built. Like 'Jubilee,' she
is broad and shallow of body, the fin being of a separate construction,
and this with its bulb of 15 tons weight was attached to the vessel in
New York, the hull having been built in Wilmington on the Delaware. She
carried her bulb 23 ft. below water, which gave her good stability and
power to hold her course when sailing to windward; but with her, as in
some measure with 'Jubilee,' they did not represent any authorised,
well-tested type of yacht, and though their performances were
interesting and highly instructive, they did not fill the mind of the
true yachtsman with glowing satisfaction, seeing that the work that was
in hand was one of national importance and required designs of equally
high character. The middle of July found all four yachts in sailing, if
not racing, trim; their owners scrupulously avoided contact with each
other; each claimed unheard-of speed and other noble qualities; and each
felt that his craft was that on which would rest the honour of defending
the America Cup. It was soon found that the booms of 'Colonia' and
'Vigilant' were not satisfactory; they were not stiff enough to hold the
sail where it should be to ensure a flat set, and when swung off their
weight was found to list the yacht too much, both of which difficulties
were to be expected in spars of their length and diameter (100 ft. long
by 16 in.). Hollow booms of different construction were tried. Those
where the spar was sawed lengthwise and the core dug out, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page404" name="page404"></a>(p. 404)</span> then
glued and trenailed together, were found to be the best. Booms of highly
elaborate construction made for 'Colonia' and 'Vigilant' were tried and
found unsuitable. They were built up of long staves, having double skins
which were well glued and fastened, and weighed less than half the solid
spar; they were 30 in. at slings, 18 in. at after, and 15 in. at forward
ends, but they evidently were lacking in material enough to endure the
tension on one side and the compression on the other, and were condemned
after a short trial.</p>

<p>In the first regatta of the N.Y.Y.C. cruise on August 7, 'Colonia' and
'Vigilant' met; it was at the head of Long Island Sound, triangular
course.</p>

<p>There came a puff of wind a moment after starting, and before the
defenders sailed a mile 'Vigilant' broke down and withdrew, leaving
'Colonia' without an opponent, as 'Jubilee' and 'Pilgrim' did not join
the fleet until later.</p>

<p>The race for the Goelet Cups off Newport on August 11 was famous for
first bringing together all four of the 'Defenders,' and infamous in the
annals of yachting for being the most disappointing occasion that was
ever remembered. Calms varied by light baffling breezes, generally from
the east; mists mitigated by clearing moments, which finally settled
into a hopeless calm and densest of fogs. 'Colonia' came drifting home
nearly fifteen hours from the start, with 'Vigilant' and 'Jubilee' an
hour or two behind. 'Pilgrim' had long before withdrawn. The course was
from Brenton's Reef light-vessel to that at the entrance to Vineyard
Sound, thence a short leg to the light-vessel at the entrance of
Buzzard's Bay, and thence to the point of starting&mdash;about thirty-six
miles.</p>

<p>The only fact disclosed by this race was that 'Jubilee' was as good as
'Vigilant' in beating out to the Vineyard Light, and that 'Vigilant' was
faster than 'Jubilee' in reaching, for the latter was caught and passed
by 'Vigilant' a few moments before the wind wholly disappeared.</p>

<p>During the continuation of the cruise there were several <span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406"></a>(p. 406)</span>

<p>The races for the Astor Cups off Newport were in the main unsatisfactory
as real tests of speed and desirable qualities, but in all it was more
and more assured that 'Vigilant' was the best, and also that 'Pilgrim'
was far from fulfilling the expectations of those responsible for her.
The August races ended without affording any definite information as to
the comparative value of the 'Defenders,' but there was a growing
opinion that 'Vigilant' was best, with 'Colonia' and 'Jubilee' about
even, and 'Pilgrim' well astern; this classification, however, was from
inference rather than any absolute test. 'Jubilee' and 'Pilgrim' went to
Boston to prepare for the final trial, to take place off New York in a
series of races beginning September 7. It was decided by the owners of
'Pilgrim' to give her more power; lead was added to her bulb, spars
lengthened, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page407" name="page407"></a>(p. 407)</span> sail-spread increased. 'Jubilee' underwent only
minor alterations, whilst 'Colonia' and 'Vigilant' tried to improve the
set of their sails (a hopeless task) and otherwise prepared for the
all-important final race. In the first of the trial series 'Colonia' and
'Vigilant' were about even, the Boston boats being disabled by damage to
their gear. The second and third races were victories for 'Vigilant,'
the last race being sailed in a fine wind and fairly rough sea.</p>

<p>Those who wanted to see an actual test of qualities were again bitterly
disappointed, for the Boston boats did not show as they might have done
had their rigging and spars remained intact; but in the case of
'Pilgrim' it was clear that her increased sail-spread and consequent
augmentation of weights below and aloft imposed too severe strains on
her hull and rigging, so that structural weakness became alarmingly
evident before the close of the race, when she was at once put out of
commission, since which she has been sold, and will appear next as a
harbour steamer for passengers.</p>

<p>The choice of 'Vigilant' to defend the cup was a wise one&mdash;in fact, the
committee could decide nothing else, for it was clear that 'Colonia'
could not do good work to windward, through lack of lateral resistance;
and 'Jubilee,' although unquestionably a very fast yacht&mdash;in some
instances the equal of 'Vigilant'&mdash;was rigged with such untrustworthy
material that she could not be depended upon to enter so important a
struggle as the defence of the America Cup. After the trial races and
consequent choice of 'Vigilant' as defender, public attention was
centred on the coming of 'Valkyrie.' Day after day passed and yet no
news of her; at last anxiety was felt for her safety, seeing that she
had not been positively reported since her sailing. But, after a thirty
days' voyage, she appeared at sunrise off Sandy Hook, none the worse for
her stormy passage.</p>

<p>'Valkyrie' was quickly put in racing trim, and on the arrival of Lord
Dunraven all the final arrangements for the contest were settled and
both yachts prepared for the struggle, the last act <span class="pagenum"><a id="page408" name="page408"></a>(p. 408)</span> being the
docking of them to make their wetted surfaces as smooth and repellent of
water as possible.</p>

<p>The America Cup races were set to begin on October 5 and four following
alternate days, the first, third, and last to be 15 knots from the
lightship off Sandy Hook and return in a course parallel with the wind;
the second and fourth races to be triangular, 10 knots on each leg, to
start from the same point, and to have one leg to windward; all races to
be started from a single gun, and to be sailed in a limit of six hours.</p>

<p>As the day approached the excitement became intense; yachtsmen and
sportsmen flocked to New York from all parts of the country. Betting ran
in favour of 'Vigilant' (3 to 2), some bets being taken at large odds
against 'Valkyrie's' not being able to win a single race in the series.</p>

<p>To windward 'Valkyrie' gained 1 min. 55 secs. Off the wind 'Vigilant'
gained 4 mins. 8 secs. 'Vigilant' won by 40 secs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page410" name="page410"></a>(p. 410)</span> Every steamer, tugboat, or anything propelled by an engine
within 250 miles of the scene of the contest was pressed into service;
and the fleet by sail and steam started for New York, bearing eager,
interested men who had laid aside every business or social engagement to
witness what was felt to be the greatest yachting event the world had
ever known.</p>

<p>The 5th came. The bay and surrounding waters were alive with craft
loaded with excited spectators, but all were doomed to the bitterest
disappointment. It was a perfectly exasperating day&mdash;light winds varied
by calms; and spectators saw the nation's hope absolutely forsaken by
the treacherous breeze, whilst her opponent sailed away with favouring
flaws until the American was hopelessly distanced. The time limit was
reached before two-thirds of the course were covered, and yachtsmen as
well as spectators returned utterly disgusted. The abortive race of the
5th afforded not the slightest clue to the comparative value of the
contending yachts, so on the 7th the prospects of the coming race were
as uncertain as ever.</p>

<p>The day was again disheartening; a waning westerly wind gave no promise
of a good race; the attendance was still large, but there was a decided
falling off in numbers from the first day.</p>

<p>The yachts were sent off east by south at a six or seven mile pace, the
'Vigilant' slowly gaining; but when about half-way to the outer mark
'Vigilant' took a start and rapidly drew away from 'Valkyrie,' so that
when within three miles of the mark she was one and a quarter mile in
the lead. Here a soft spot in the wind occurred, and 'Valkyrie' drew on
the brass-bottomed boat; but at that moment the wind shifted more
southerly, blowing over the quarter rail of the yachts, and 'Vigilant'
again drew away from her pursuer, turning nearly a mile and a half in
advance.</p>

<p>The wind having changed in direction there was no windward work, the
yachts returning two or three points free, and maintaining the same
relative distance at the close as at the outer mark. The race of the
7th, although a decided <span class="pagenum"><a id="page411" name="page411"></a>(p. 411)</span> victory for the American, was not
generally considered as a satisfactory test of sailing qualities; the
wind was unsteady in force and direction, and to some extent fluky, but
in the opinion of those who were competent to judge, the 'luck' was
rather more on the side of the 'Valkyrie' than the 'Vigilant,' the
English, however, stoutly declaring the reverse.</p>

<p>The real value of the two yachts in windward work was still unknown, and
although 'Vigilant' had scored by a good margin one race, still the
result was then quite uncertain.</p>

<p>October 9 opened with a fair promise of wind; the interest was still
deep and the attendance large; the course was triangular, ten miles each
side. The first leg was to windward; the yachts started about equal as
to time and position.</p>

<p>At first 'Valkyrie' seemed to lead&mdash;that is, she outfooted the American;
but the latter was slowly edging up toward the wind, and later, when a
good weather position was gained by 'Vigilant,' her skipper gave her
more power, and with the increasing wind she rapidly left her opponent
astern, rounding the first mark well in the lead.</p>

<p>The next leg was a broad run, and all that witnessed it unite in
declaring that yachts never made such time in a race before. They flew;
but 'Vigilant' flew the faster, and nearly doubled the handsome lead
that she had obtained on the rounding of the first mark.</p>

<p>The home leg was with a freshening free wind two points forward of beam.
It was made without incident, save that 'Vigilant' had to favour her
bowsprit that was sprung on the windward stretch, her jib-topsail was
lowered, and head-sails eased in regard for the weakened spar. On the
home stretch 'Vigilant' still further widened the distance between her
and the English yacht, and made a most decided point in her favour. The
race was a fine one, but it seemed to seal the fate of 'Valkyrie'; still
with native pluck her undaunted owner made ready for the next race. By a
most masterful stroke a new mainsail was bent, and more lead given the
cutter, so that she lost fifteen seconds of time allowance from the
American.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page412" name="page412"></a>(p. 412)</span> October 11th proved another disappointing day. Light breezes
and calms ruled; the beat of fifteen miles resulted in no decisive
difference in the sailing of the yachts, for when the time-limit was
reached the yachts were far from home, with the American yacht leading.</p>

<p>On the 12th a gale was reported as working up the coast, and great hopes
were entertained of a fresh wind for the fifth start. Many thought that
the American yacht would beat her opponent more easily in a strong wind
and rough sea, but they were disappointed, as the sequel proved. When
October 13 dawned an easterly gale was blowing up; early in the morning
the wind began to pipe and the sea to roughen, and by the time of
starting the wind had set in strong and steadily from the east. After
some delay caused by an accident to the rigging of 'Valkyrie,' that was
speedily repaired on board, the two yachts shot away for a fifteen-mile
thresh to windward, the 'Valkyrie' at the south end of the line, and
'Vigilant' at the north end&mdash;a fair start. At first 'Vigilant' outfooted
'Valkyrie' and held nearly or quite as well to the wind; but when the
windward work was about half finished the wind drew more from the south
of east, it soon began to increase in good earnest, and from that moment
'Valkyrie' got further away from 'Vigilant,' and turned the outer mark
nearly two minutes ahead. On starting, the yachts had each a reef down,
'Vigilant' a whole reef, 'Valkyrie' a half reef in her mainsail, each
her working topsail set, with usual head-sails. After the mark was
turned it became apparent that if 'Vigilant' were to win she must work,
and, as it proved, no lack of energy was displayed on either yacht. The
reef was turned out of 'Vigilant's' mainsail, and her No. 1 club topsail
set over it. The storm that had been threatening all day now began to
increase, the wind rose rapidly and the sea became very rough.</p>

<p>'Vigilant' gained noticeably on her opponent, and passed her when about
half-way to the home point. The contest was now most exciting; the
rigging of both yachts was strained to the last degree. Soon after the
'Valkyrie' was passed by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page413" name="page413"></a>(p. 413)</span> 'Vigilant,' her spinnaker, that was
torn in setting, became disabled by splitting; another but smaller one
was set in its place, but that also soon gave way to the ever-increasing
force of the wind. The last three miles of the race were a mad rush for
the 'Vigilant'; she carried all the sail that could be spread, and it
seemed that an inch more of canvas would carry everything by the board.
She gained more quickly than ever on her crippled follower, and crossed
a close winner in the midst of the most exciting scene that yachting
annals have ever recorded.</p>

<p>It is hard to say if the 'Vigilant' would have won had 'Valkyrie' not
lost her light sails; but if the latter claims that her race was thus
lost, 'Vigilant,' with equal sense of right, can claim that a
maladjustment of her centreboard lost her at least five minutes on the
beat out.</p>

<p>Closely following the termination of the races both yachts were put into
winter quarters, and owners as well as crews took breath, enjoying a
well-earned rest. It is not possible at this early moment to draw any
absolutely settled conclusions as to the merits or demerits of the
contesting yachts. Fortunately Lord Dunraven decided to leave 'Valkyrie'
in the States for a continuation of the contest in 1894, when if the
races that are now hoped for occur, and all the yachts take part that
now promise to do so, it will be a far more useful and interesting
contest than was afforded by the races of 1893.</p>

<p>A few points that are worth considering force themselves on the close
observer of the international races of 1893.</p>

<p>October is one of the worst periods of the whole year for racing, at
least during the first half of the month; the winds then are light and
inconstant in force and direction, and calms are of longer duration than
at any period during the yachting season.</p>

<p>From August 15 until September 20 is without doubt the most favourable
time for racing, and when another international contest is contemplated,
it is to be hoped that the races will be set at least three weeks
earlier than those of 1893.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page414" name="page414"></a>(p. 414)</span> This international sport awakens such a widespread interest,
serving, as it were, as a great national school in yachting and racing,
that it is to be hoped as much facility as possible may be afforded the
public for witnessing them; therefore, let all international races be
held in New York waters, where they were in 1893, as that point is more
accessible than any other to those interested. We in America must
establish some school for the training of skippers and crews; there is
not to-day a professional skipper in the country, nor a crew that is
capable of sailing a yacht against the English. The best school possible
is actual racing, and when we present to our yachtsmen a racing list as
long as that published in England, then we can hope to have captains and
men fit to hold their own. The English may learn of the Americans how to
design a yacht that will bear pushing to extreme speeds without making
such a disturbance in the water as did 'Valkyrie.' They can also take
lessons in staying the mast and masthead, and in proportioning the sizes
of spars and standing rigging more closely to the labour assigned them.
The Americans may learn of the English how to make canvas that will
stand where it is desired; and when it is made they can also learn of
them how to make sails and how to set them; and in general to copy the
management of their yachts when racing, that when we meet the English in
international races we may be able to rig and sail our yachts in such
manner that an expert would be able to say whether any advantage on
either side was due to design, or if not to that factor alone, to place
the cause of advantage where it belongs, so that the lesson set by such
races may be of some benefit to those who have the improvement of
yacht-designing and sailing near their hearts.</p>

<p>The long-mooted question of keel <i lang="la"><abbr title="versus">v.</abbr></i> centreboard still remains
unanswered, and in fact it never can be determined as a general rule. In
close windward work there seems little or no difference between the keel
and centreboard as to speed; the latter has some advantage when sailing
free by raising the board, thus lessening the wetted surface of the
yacht.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page415" name="page415"></a>(p. 415)</span> The great and undeniable superiority of the centreboard lies in
the fact that a yacht possessing it can essentially reduce her draught
of water so as to work in depths that would be wholly impossible for the
keel vessel. It would seem, therefore, that the advantage gained in the
use of the centreboard is mainly not one of sailing qualities, but one
of desirability for use in certain locations where shallow water
prevails.</p>

<p>The interest exhibited in the international races by those who were able
to be present has already been mentioned, but it yet remains to notice
the astonishing degree of excitement as to the result of the races
evinced by the public at large.</p>

<p>From Maine to California, and from Michigan to Florida, news of the
struggle was eagerly awaited, and in all the cities, towns, and even
villages the exact position of the yachts was exposed on a bulletin
board, the news being sent by telegraph every five or ten minutes, or
more often if the change of position of the yachts demanded it. In some
of the larger cities where the interest was most intense such crowds
collected in front of the bulletin boards that traffic had to be
suspended; in New York City the stock-board was deserted, and business
generally was at a standstill.</p>

<span class="smcap">By Sir George Leach, K.C.B.</span></h2>

<p>On October 5th, the opening day of the races, the first thing to strike
the observer was the extraordinary number and diversity of craft
attracted by the spectacle. Near the Sandy Hook Lightship we find the
racers were under way, with whole mainsails and jackyarders set.
'Vigilant' looks a bigger ship than 'Valkyrie,' with a more numerous
crew, and four battens in the leach of her mainsail and three in her
staysail. The two vessels were easily distinguished one from the other,
'Vigilant' being painted white above her bright yellow Tobin bronze,
'Valkyrie' black with gilt line. The starting-line was between the
commodore's steam yacht 'May,' the New York Club's flagship, and Sandy
Hook Lightship. There was no tide. The wind was a little east of north,
and the course 15 miles to leeward round a mark and back. 'Vigilant'
allowed 'Valkyrie' 1 min. 48 secs. The first gun was at 11.15 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, the
start gun 10 mins. after. Just prior to the start the yachts set their
head-sails. 'Vigilant' sent up a large bowsprit spinnaker, a very
favourite sail in American waters, and 'Valkyrie' a large jib-topsail.
The crowd was immense, excursion steamers, tugs, yachts; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page417" name="page417"></a>(p. 417)</span> and
at the start came the horrible screech of steam whistles, customary on
these occasions, but dreadful all the same.</p>

<p>Spinnakers were at once run up on the starboard side, but the wind was
so light that, in spite of the enormous sail-areas, little progress was
made. By noon the sky was clear and the sun came out, but at 1.30 there
was a marked change. The wind shifted, and a light air came from S.W.
'Vigilant' took in her bowsprit spinnaker a little too soon, for
'Valkyrie,' holding on somewhat longer, ran up, and passing to windward
so effectually blanketed 'Vigilant' that she lost steerage way for some
ten minutes. During this time 'Valkyrie' crept up to the S.W. wind, and
was going on her way rejoicing. The S.W. wind held true; it became a
close haul to the mark, which 'Valkyrie' rounded at 3 hrs. 37 mins. 20
secs. The 15 miles took 4 hrs. 12 mins. 'Vigilant' rounded at 4 hrs. 2
mins. 30 secs., twenty-five minutes after 'Valkyrie,' whose performance
created great disappointment to English sympathisers. At 5.10 the
Committee stopped the race&mdash;if race it could be called. The excitement
on shore as well as afloat was intense. Upwards of 200 steamers of
various kinds accompanied the race, all crowded with spectators, and
some of them got terribly in the way at the start of the race, the
police-boat warning them off, and 'Valkyrie' holding up from her deck,
in large letters, 'Keep further off.' On the whole, the course was
fairly kept, and there was certainly no intention to injure 'Valkyrie's'
chance&mdash;quite the contrary. I am happy to say the spirit of <em>fair</em> play
appeared to animate all; the anxiety of the captains of the steamers to
show their friends as much as possible was really the sole cause of
trespass.</p>

<p>This day's race was another example of the frequency with which races to
windward and leeward and return fail in their object, especially in
early October in these waters, when the wind is more fluky and lighter
than at any other time of the year. If the S.W. wind had piped up a
little, it would have been a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page418" name="page418"></a>(p. 418)</span> reach both ways. On the whole,
triangular races are best courses.</p>

<p>On the second day, October 7, after rain in the early morning, it became
fine and bright as the New York Club's steamer left No. 8 Pier at 9.15.
Not quite so many steamers appeared, although there were probably over
150, many large excursion ones, and yachts. One yacht stood prominently
out, and was conspicuous for her taut brig rig and large tonnage,
2,400&mdash;a grand vessel, the 'Valiant,' designed by St. Clare Byrne for
Mr. Vanderbilt, and built at Liverpool. There was also a large yacht of
the 'Chazalie' type; and I may also mention Commodore Morgan's steam
yacht 'May,' designed by Mr. G. L. Watson. The wind, W. by S., was still
very light, with a gentle swell from the southward. Course, 15 miles to
leeward, round mark, and return. The start at 11.25 was admirable.
'Valkyrie,' beautifully handled, out-man&oelig;uvred 'Vigilant,' and
crossed the line to windward about 10 secs. ahead. Spinnakers were at
once hauled out on the starboard side, both setting balloon jib-topsails
and lowering foresails. Bowsprit spinnakers are more correctly to be
termed balloon jib-topsails, the difference being that the balloon
jib-topsail is hanked on the stay. 'Vigilant' drew ahead, and at 12.25
was a quarter of a mile in front. 'Vigilant,' a quarter of a mile to the
eastward, got a streak of wind and increased her lead, her balloon
jib-topsail drawing well. At 1.30 'Vigilant' was nearly a mile ahead;
she tacked round the mark 1 hr. 50 mins. 30 secs., 'Valkyrie' following
at 1.59, when she was bothered by a small steamer. The 15 miles took
2&frac12; hrs. to accomplish, but on the return there was no beating to
windward, a close haul with jib-topsails set. The windward work was
again frustrated by shift of wind. It was a plain sail home, and</p>

<p>It will be well to remember that here velocity does not indicate
strength as we feel it at home. As Lord Dunraven particularly noticed,
the dryness of the wind reduces the pressure, which the moisture of our
climate so materially increases.</p>

<p>The result of the race seemed to show that the two yachts were fairly
matched, so that if one got a slice of luck the other was not likely to
recover without a slice too, or a good streak. The course was better
kept; but, although the race was not affected by it, the 'Valkyrie' was
favoured by the wash of steamers on the return from the mark-boat.</p>

<p>On the third day, October 9, everything promised well; the weather was
all that could be desired to test the relative merits of the two racers;
the morning bright, with a good topsail breeze, and the white crests on
the wavelets gave hopes of great sport. The Club steamer left the pier
at 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; but on our arrival at Sandy Hook no breeze was there. The
steamers were fewer in number; I had, however, no difficulty after the
start in counting fifty, besides yachts under canvas. Going down the
river we passed one very striking object, the well-known gigantic and
magnificent statue of Liberty, which stands on a small island. I must
say I never saw anything finer, either in conception or execution.</p>

<p>The wind was from the S.W., the course triangular, round marks placed by
steamers with a large red ball hoisted, the steamers remaining near to
indicate their positions, which were so stationed as to make each side
of the triangle ten miles. Both yachts carried jackyarders and
jib-topsails. The start took place at 11.30, after some pretty
man&oelig;uvring as usual, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page420" name="page420"></a>(p. 420)</span> 'Valkyrie' getting the weather berth,
and a little ahead. About 12.30 the wind increased, with a little jump
of sea, and both went round on the port tack; here 'Vigilant's' power
began to tell. 'Vigilant' bore round the first mark at 1 hr. 6 mins.,
and 'Valkyrie' 4 mins. 50 secs. later. A broad reach on starboard
followed, 'Vigilant' setting her balloon jib-topsail very smartly. Soon
after this 'Vigilant' sprung her bowsprit and took in her jib-topsail.
The second mark was rounded by 'Vigilant' at 2 hrs. 1 min., 'Valkyrie'
at 2 hrs. 10 mins. 3 secs.</p>

<p>Now came the last ten-mile reach on the port tack to the finish. The
wind piped up still stronger; but 'Vigilant,' though carrying only a
small jib-topsail, still increased her lead, finishing a winner at 2
hrs. 49 mins. 3 secs., 'Valkyrie' coming in 12 mins. 20 secs. after her.
After deducting time allowance she lost the race by 10 mins. 32 secs.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, October 11, the start was delayed, the competitors
hoping for wind, but it was made at 1.45. Course, south by west to
windward and back. 'Valkyrie,' there is no doubt, was always beautifully
handled, and it would be wrong not to recognise the ability Cranfield
has shown throughout, whether in man&oelig;uvring for the line or in
sailing 'Valkyrie' during the races in waters far from home. To these he
is not a stranger, having had some experience with Sir Richard Sutton in
the 'Genesta' (1885) when sailing against 'Puritan.' This race, October
11, could not be finished within the prescribed time, six hours, and
therefore the tugs took the competitors in tow, homeward bound.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, October 13, the course was to windward and leeward.
This was the great day, and included many most <span class="pagenum"><a id="page421" name="page421"></a>(p. 421)</span> exciting
episodes. 'Valkyrie' had altered her trim, but news had arrived of a
hard blow in the south, and in heavy weather what could she do against
the more powerful boat, the 'Vigilant'? The weather was overcast and
cloudy, wind S.E., blowing moderately at Sandy Hook Lightship. When
'Valkyrie' was below the Narrows her mainsail was lowered, one of the
throat-halliard blocks had to be repaired, and it was 11.19 before she
neared the starting point. The course, due east, was given from the
steam yacht 'May.' Signals now came from 'Vigilant,' 'Time wanted for
repairs.' Her centreboard was jammed, but finally it was lowered about
eleven feet. At 12.7 the Blue Peter was run up on the flagship. The two
were under the same canvas, each with jibheader over single-reef
mainsails, foresail, and jib. At 12.17 came the preparatory gun, and
then began some of the prettiest man&oelig;uvring ever seen in these waters
as the two big cutters chased each other like a couple of kittens for
the weather berth. 'Valkyrie' passed the line up to windward 12 hrs. 27
mins. 10 secs., 'Vigilant' to leeward 3 secs. later. It was a long tack,
some six miles, towards Long Island, 'Valkyrie' carrying her canvas
decidedly the better of the two; to-day she was notably stiff&mdash;in fact,
at no time has she ever been tender. She pointed as high as 'Vigilant,'
and held her weather berth easily. The latter was heeling over much at 1
hr. 18 mins. 'Valkyrie' was on her weather bow. 'Vigilant's' jibsheet
got adrift. The wind was now stronger, and they were getting a head sea,
which did not suit 'Vigilant's' beam and bow.</p>

<p>This long tack lasted an hour, and at 2.15 'Valkyrie' led by
three-eighths of a mile. As they neared the outer mark the time was</p>

<p>In the beat to windward of fifteen miles 'Valkyrie' gained 1 min. 55
sec.</p>

<p>Spinnakers were now on both, the wind increasing, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page422" name="page422"></a>(p. 422)</span> at 2.47
'Valkyrie's' biggest balloon jib-topsail went up. 'Vigilant' had some
trouble forward with hers, and a hand was smartly sent down the topmast
stay before the sail could be sent up in stops. At 2.50 it broke up and
revealed that favourite sail in America a balloon jib-topsail, and a
rare good puller it is. Some very smart work was now done on board
'Vigilant' on the run. The reef in the mainsail was shaken out by a hand
slung from the masthead in the bight of a gaut-line, and hauled along
the boom by an outhaul as he cast off the stops. Next a hand was out on
the gaff. This led to hoisting the second club topsail over the
jibheader left standing to leeward, and just before the club topsail
went up she ran through 'Valkyrie's' lee. 'Valkyrie's' white spinnaker
burst. It was most smartly taken in, and the light one set. This split
before it was belayed, from head to foot, right down, and 'Valkyrie's'
chance had now gone. A large jib-topsail was set on her, but was of no
use against the sail area of 'Vigilant.' Some ten minutes more and</p>

<p>On this day the course was kept very clear. The wind increased at the
finish, but the fact that 'Vigilant' carried full mainsail, second club
topsail, balloon jib-topsail, and large spinnaker, shows that it was not
blowing the gale described by some journalists.</p>

<p>After the finish in the lower bay the wind piped up, the sea got up, and
all raced hard for home.</p>

<p>It was a splendid race, nobly sailed, and both yachts admirably handled.
There always must be some luck, but it was most untimely for
'Valkyrie's' spinnakers to burst. The question at once suggests itself,
should they not be sent up in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page423" name="page423"></a>(p. 423)</span> stops? 'Valkyrie's' mast was
sprung and worse, and that prevented her getting more canvas put on her.
When one yacht gains to windward and the other to leeward they must be
well matched; in England we consider that windward work should take
precedence of running free. For English waters 'Valkyrie' is a most
successful and beautiful craft, and for American waters, with light
winds and long reaching, 'Vigilant' has proved a great success.
Certainly this last race was the grandest ever sailed for the America
Cup, and we may be proud of our representative. The 1,200 feet of
sail-area in 'Vigilant,' and extra crew, gave her a decided advantage,
and the centreboard was supposed to be a gain to windward; but that good
sportsman Lord Dunraven is not disheartened in any way, neither is he
won over to centreboard yachts.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page425" name="page425"></a>(p. 425)</span> APPENDIX<br>
<span class="smaller">THE 'GIRALDA'</span></h2>

<p>It chances that while these volumes were being prepared, a steam yacht
of a remarkable character was being built, and it seems desirable to
include a few words about this vessel, for the reason that she is,
perhaps, the most perfect boat ever constructed for a private gentleman.
Reference is made to the magnificent twin-screw steam yacht 'Giralda,'
the property of Mr. Harry McCalmont of Cheveley Park, Newmarket.
'Giralda' gives evidence of the perfection to which vessels of this type
are now being brought. She is about 1,800 tons yacht measurement, and
her principal dimensions are: Length between perpendiculars, 275 feet;
breadth moulded, 35 feet; depth moulded, 19 feet. She is built with
thirteen water-tight bulkheads of Siemens-Martin's steel to Lloyd's
highest class, and so constructed as to be readily converted into a
light-armed cruiser or despatch vessel for Admiralty requirements.</p>

<p>A notable point will be her speed of twenty knots, to develop which she
is fitted with twin-screw machinery and five boilers, three of which are
double-ended, and two single-ended, with sixteen furnaces, all adapted
for forced draught. The machinery consists of two independent and
separate sets of triple-expansion direct-acting surface-condensing
engines, one set to each screw propeller, and will indicate with forced
draught 6,500 horse-power, or with natural draught 5,000 horse-power.
The bunker capacity is 400 tons of coal, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page426" name="page426"></a>(p. 426)</span> and the fresh-water
tanks are ample for Admiralty requirements; in addition to which she is
fitted with fresh-water condenser capable of producing 1,200 gallons per
diem. The yacht is also fitted with large ice-house and refrigerating
chamber.</p>

<p>One of the special features in the 'Giralda' is that the
saloons&mdash;consisting of smoking-room, boudoir, or library, spacious
dining saloon and drawing-room&mdash;are all on the main deck, where there
are also situated lavatories for cabins and crew, three galleys, and
ample pantry and service spaces. Owner's sleeping accommodation is
below, fore and abaft the machinery space, having intercommunication on
the main deck through the house. The officers and crew are berthed
forward, and the servants' quarters are aft. It is almost unnecessary to
add that the cabin accommodation has had the most special attention,
both in respect of arrangement and fittings, and the greatest care has
been taken throughout for ventilating, heating, and insulation where
necessary. A large bridge or shade deck extends along about 160 feet of
the vessel, on which, forward, is the bridge, and also the chart and
wheel houses. The boats are housed on this deck, and there is steam
hoisting gear for steam launch and larger boats.</p>

<p>The yacht is lighted throughout by electricity, there being over 200
incandescent lamps. In addition to these, there are fitted two
regulation-size search lights, and groups of electric lights for each
mast. There are two separate and independent engines and dynamos,
connected with large accumulators of sufficient capacity to supply the
whole of the lamps for many hours without re-charging.</p>

<p>Mr. McCalmont has himself taken the very greatest personal interest in
the arrangement of all details, which have been carried out by Messrs.
Cox &amp; King, of Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, London, under the direction of
Professor Elgar, the designer of the well-known Fairfield Shipbuilding
and Engineering Co., of Govan, Glasgow by whom the yacht is being
built.</p>
